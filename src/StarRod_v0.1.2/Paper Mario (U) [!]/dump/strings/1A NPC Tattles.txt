[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's the archaeologist, Kolorado.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's famous as both a scholar[BR]
and an explorer.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Unfortunately, he's also[BR]
renowned for his carelessness.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's wild about treasures and[BR]
ancient secrets, so he's always[BR]
taking off around the world on[BR]
some adventure.[WAIT][END]

1A-001
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a Koopa Troopa from the[BR]
excavation team.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]The team is assisting Kolorado.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That looks like hard work.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Doing chores in this heat? Ugh![WAIT][END]

1A-002
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's Chuck Quizmo. He tries to[BR]
quiz anybody who speaks to him.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He pops up in various towns and[BR]
villages, but that doesn't mean[BR]
he's easy to find.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What do you think his deal is?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Personally, I'm a little more[BR]
interested in his assistant.[BR]
She's cute![WAIT][END]

1A-003
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad is one of the castle[BR]
maids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Seeing as the castle has up and[BR]
disappeared, I guess they've[BR]
decided to take a holiday.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Traveling does have a way of[BR]
refreshing the body and mind.[WAIT][END]

1A-004
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad is one of the castle[BR]

1A-005
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad is one of the castle[BR]
maids.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]She's always been very curious.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder what kind of trip[BR]
they're taking.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's definitely not going to be[BR]
as difficult as our journey, but[BR]
I'm kind of curious.[WAIT][END]

1A-006
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's Jr. Troopa. He used to[BR]
boot us out of the forest near[BR]
Goomba Village. He thinks he's[BR]
pretty tough.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As far as I can tell, he goes[BR]
around picking fights with people[BR]
who are stronger than he is.[BR]
Talk about dumb![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
His hobbies are working out and[BR]
ordering stuff by mail.[WAIT][END]

1A-007
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's the Toad who hands out [BR]
prizes at the radio Trading[BR]
Event.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you take the item mentioned[BR]
on the radio, he'll hook you up[BR]
with a rare item.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You really should participate in[BR]
the Trading Event, Mario.[WAIT][END]

1A-008
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}She's a gorgeous lady named[BR]
Merluvlee. I can't believe I'm in[BR]
the same room with her![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She foresees events and uses[BR]
her magic powers to find what[BR]
you're looking for.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]She's very accurate.[BR]

I think I'm in love... She's[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's Merlow.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's about the same age as[BR]

I wanna play with him when we[BR]
finish our adventure.[BR]

I guess he trades Star Pieces[BR]
for Badges.[BR]

Merluvlee, who's downstairs, is[BR]
his sister. He's so lucky![WAIT][END]

And why does he look so... dim?[BR]
I can see right through him.[WAIT][END]

1A-00B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}She's the Star Spirit, Misstar.[BR]
She was imprisoned by Bowser in[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's a merchant by the name of[BR]
Rip Cheato.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Who knows why he set up here...[BR]

I guess it doesn't matter.[BR]
People can sell stuff wherever[BR]

I actually kind of like it here.[BR]
It's like a secret fort![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's The Master of the Dojo.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's been training students at[BR]
the Dojo for years.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My grandpa told me he's[BR]
incredibly strong.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He doesn't look like it, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think he just got back from a[BR]
long journey where he trained[BR]
with fighters stronger than[BR]
he is. What dedication![WAIT][END]

1A-010
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's Chan. He's one of the[BR]
trainees who seem to always be[BR]
at the Dojo.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He worships The Master.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean, it's all well and good[BR]
for Chan to admire The Master,[BR]
but I prefer Mario![WAIT][END]

1A-011
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's one of the trainees who's [BR]
always at the Dojo. His name is[BR]
Lee.[BR]

He's like an older brother to[BR]

Lee respects The Master above[BR]
all else and hangs on every word[BR]
he says.[WAIT][END]

1A-012
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That Toad runs this shop.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He buys, sells and checks items.[BR]

able to hold everything.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Check items when you can.[WAIT][END]

1A-013
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad is always standing in[BR]
front of the gate.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Is it his [PAUSE:03]job, maybe?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He looks as if he's asleep on his[BR]

a bit about the town.[WAIT][END]

1A-014
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad always stands in front[BR]
of the shop.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He knows all about items.[BR]

He never moves, as far as I can[BR]
tell. Maybe he's trying to get a[BR]
tan.[WAIT][END]

1A-015
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad is always very excited[BR]
about whatever news he has.[BR]
He's a little crazy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even so, it's a good idea to[BR]
listen to him.[BR]
[PAUSE:08]He may be a little excitable, but[BR]
he always has news.[WAIT][END]

1A-016
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad claims that he and his[BR]
girl are in love.[BR]

But just the other day, he told[BR]
me he liked a different girl![BR]
What a cad![WAIT][END]

1A-017
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Those Toads are in love.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]They're so in love, they don't[BR]
even notice what's going on.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Unless you like seeing public[BR]
displays of affection, I wouldn't[BR]
talk to them.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They're shameless. [WAIT][END]

1A-018
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}She is the oldest of these three[BR]
Toad sisters. Apparently they[BR]
call themselves the [BR]
"Three Beautiful Sisters."[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I personally don't think they're[BR]
that attractive, but I guess for[BR]
Toads, they are.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Goombas and Toads think about[BR]
beauty in different ways, I[BR]
guess.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What do you think, Mario?[WAIT][END]

1A-019
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}She is the second oldest of[BR]
these three Toad sisters.[BR]
Apparently they call themselves[BR]
the "Three Beautiful Sisters."[BR]

with makeup to look gorgeous.[BR]

cutest of the three.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He doesn't seem to have any [BR]
particular reason to be at the[BR]
Dojo. He's not fighting.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He just loiters around, checking[BR]
out the fighters.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe he just likes watching[BR]
tough guys.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I bet he'll cheer for us if we[BR]
challenge The Master.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This family man ordinarily works[BR]

He's a very reliable worker at[BR]
the castle...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]but he never does chores around[BR]
the house.[WAIT][END]

1A-01D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}She's the homemaker here. She's[BR]
ordinarily very relaxed and[BR]
easygoing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since her lazy husband is home,[BR]
she's working harder than ever[BR]
right now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]

it all with no help.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Where does she get the energy?[WAIT][END]

1A-01E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's one of the Toad kids.[BR]

I guess he's a pretty good[BR]
friend of mine.[WAIT][END]

1A-01F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's a Toad kid who wants to be[BR]
really powerful.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He thinks that having power[BR]
solves everything.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
His way of thinking is a little[BR]

when we play together.[WAIT][END]

1A-020
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad has tried his skills[BR]

He uses magical powers to look[BR]

Still, his fortune-telling is[BR]
supposedly right on.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]I don't know personally, but my[BR]
Goompa told me.[WAIT][END]

1A-022
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Paratroopa looks extremely[BR]

1A-029
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's a funny color for a Toad.[BR]

worth it if you're curious.[WAIT][END]

1A-02D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad...[BR]

Trust me, my mom is a really[BR]
great cook,[BR]

bad trait in a guard?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Not only does he scare easily,[BR]
I hear that he's especially[BR]
afraid of ghosts.[BR]

Seeing as Forever Forest is [BR]
supposedly haunted, he must be[BR]
completely freaked out.[WAIT][END]

hard working.[BR]

out.[WAIT][END]

1A-038
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He always talks about what he[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh! A Bub-ulb.[BR]

around here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]She's elegant, don't you think?[BR]

She's almost too nice to be [BR]

she needs to learn to be more[BR]
snobby.[BR]

Then she'd seem really elegant![WAIT][END]

Pretty good, huh? Anyway, he[BR]

1A-05B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Whenever I talk to this Toad, he[BR]
tells me he wants to go[BR]
"somewhere by the sea."[BR]

but what if he got out there[BR]
and there was only ocean?[WAIT][END]

1A-05C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Toad's been all over the[BR]
place. He'll tell you lots of old[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
That's when I knew he was cool.[WAIT][END]

Sometimes the fight for justice[BR]

Goompa told me that we must[BR]

1A-091
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a Dryite.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The wind out here in the desert[BR]
is full of stinging sand, so he[BR]
protects himself by wrapping his[BR]
face in a cloth.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since their faces are covered,[BR]
it's tough to tell them apart.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm pretty sure they're all[BR]
adults, though.[WAIT][END]

1A-092
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Dryites look like the heat[BR]
doesn't even bother them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder why? I'm boiling! And[BR]
they're all wrapped up in[BR]
clothes! What gives?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe it's because their clothes[BR]
are wrapped loosely.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I could use some threads like[BR]
that.[WAIT][END]

1A-093
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Dryite is really quiet.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's shy, I guess.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]I don't see any reason for him[BR]
to be so timid.[WAIT][END]

1A-094
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These Dryites look like they have[BR]
big heads because they're[BR]
wrapped in cloth.[BR]

It's hard to tell them apart[BR]
since we can see only their eyes.[WAIT][END]

"When you're feeling lost, ask[BR]

1A-09C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a Dryite.[BR]

[PAUSE:05]I'm betting young...[WAIT][END]

There's no reason to move... His[BR]

1A-09F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's a Nomadimouse who likes[BR]
telling old tales. He knows much[BR]

I wish my hometown had such a[BR]
cool legend! Then I could act[BR]
mysterious.[WAIT][END]

1A-0A3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh! It's a Bub-ulb.[BR]

really important.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's plant 'em, Mario.[WAIT][END]

1A-0A4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He's a Boo called Bootler.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's the manager of the mansion[BR]

Lady Bow.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ordinarily his title would[BR]
be "butler."[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Being a butler is hard work.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmm... Maybe I'm just imagining[BR]
this, but doesn't it look like[BR]

he's cornered the Boo market[BR]

1A-0AC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a Boo who lives here in[BR]

You know, Boos can't be[BR]
attacked if they're invisible.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Isn't that convenient?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Whenever trouble appears, they[BR]

1A-0AD
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a Boo who lives here in[BR]

It's hard to tell if they're male[BR]

Bow does. That'd make it easier.[WAIT][END]

1A-0B1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a Boo who lives here in[BR]
Gusty Gulch.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, I think it's possible[BR]
for a ghost to be cute and[BR]
scary at the same time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It all depends on the person[BR]
they're scaring. What's cute to[BR]
one may be horrifying to another.[BR]

Don't you think Boos have[BR]
expressive faces?[BR]

They must do special face[BR]
exercises to be able to stretch[BR]
them so much. [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Pulling a face muscle would hurt.[WAIT][END]

1A-0B3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This Boo's hiding in Tubba[BR]
Blubba's Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The castle is terrifying for[BR]
Boos, so this guy has guts.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He must have come to try to find[BR]
the secret of Tubba Blubba.[BR]
That monster must have some[BR]
weakness hidden here![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This Boo is willing to risk his[BR]
own life! So brave...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]no other Boos will dare come here[BR]
because Tubba Blubba eats any[BR]
Boos he finds.[WAIT][END]

[PAUSE:0A]Even though he knows he may be[BR]
eaten, he's willing to try to[BR]
help us. How noble![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]it takes a lot of guts to walk[BR]
straight into the mouth of[BR]
danger to help others.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess he came partly to help[BR]
us but mostly to help Bow.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Every Boo loves Bow, after all.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a Bub-ulb.[BR]

[PAUSE:05]Some people call it the "Blessed[BR]

She loves mystery novels and[BR]
longs to be a great detective.[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These penguins love rumors. They[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Especially about other people.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The tiniest little rumor will[BR]
spread like wildfire around here[BR]
if they hear it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their gossip stays in town,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]so that's something, at least.[WAIT][END]

1A-0EE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}He likes rumors. He doesn't look[BR]

If he wants some excitement[BR]

eat a Volt Shroom.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That'd give him a jolt![WAIT][END]

1A-0EF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This penguin gossips, but at [BR]

He can still be wrong, though.[BR]

It doesn't matter if he confirms[BR]
