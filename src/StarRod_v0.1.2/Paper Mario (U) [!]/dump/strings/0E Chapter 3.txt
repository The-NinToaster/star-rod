If you choose the wrong paths,[BR]
you'll end up back at the forest[BR]

For example, in this area, take a[BR]

In one of them, you'll spot[BR]
strange, glowing eyes.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The exit near that tree is the[BR]
path you want to take.[BR]

You would have had to fight[BR]
Tubba Blubba to save this Star[BR]
Spirit anyway, right?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This way, you help us Boos, too.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Besides, I'm going with you. I'll[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
You? At Tubba Blubba's Castle?[BR]
Quite out of the question![BR]

I simply cannot allow you to put[BR]
yourself in such danger![WAIT][END]

0E-04F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Still your tongue, Bootler![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I've seen too much suffering[BR]

0E-050
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...alas... Then, Lady, I,[BR]
Bootler, will accompany you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It is my sworn duty to see that[BR]

He never felt full, though. Of[BR]
