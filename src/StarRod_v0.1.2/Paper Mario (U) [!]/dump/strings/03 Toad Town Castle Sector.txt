When I was reading the stars[BR]
the other day, an oracle[BR]
came to me.[BR]

What I discovered is very[BR]
important, and it concerns you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But, before I tell you about it,[BR]
there are other things of which[BR]
I must speak.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It is a very long story, but[BR]
I'll try to shorten it.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Where should I start...?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It was in the old days.[BR]
One of my ancestors was up[BR]
on Shooting Star Summit[BR]
and as usual.....[BR]

...suddenly...a great...[BR]

03-025
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...all right.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...So, anyway, that is why[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I am able to help you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you get lost during[BR]
your adventure, you[BR]
can come to me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can predict the path[BR]
you should take for[BR]
a small price.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]Right now, your main goal[BR]
must be to save Princess Peach[BR]
as quickly as is humanly[BR]
possible, but...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
according to my second sight,[BR]
your path must first take you[BR]
to the great fortress of the[BR]
Koopa Bros.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To reach the Koopa Bros.[BR]
Fortress, head east on the road[BR]
in front of the Toad House.[WAIT][END]

03-026

03-027
[STYLE:RIGHT]Come again?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Strange Toads blocking the[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]We retreat!! ...for now...[WAIT][END]

03-033
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, those imposters were[BR]
none other than the Koopa Bros.[BR]

You must pursue them to[BR]

Bros. Fortress.[WAIT][END]

03-034
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]there's one part of your[BR]
fortune I haven't revealed.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To get to the Koopa Bros.[BR]
Fortress, you'll need help from[BR]
{Color:20}a blue-shelled Koopa{Color:0A}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is a strange portent. In[BR]
{Color:20}Koopa Village{Color:0A}, you might find[BR]
something that will clear it up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I must return home now.[WAIT][END]

03-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]To get to Koopa Bros.[BR]

My fortune-telling never lies,[BR]
Mario, so heed my words.[BR]

03-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ah, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Do you want me to predict[BR]
the path you should take?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It will cost 5 coins.[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
If you require something other[BR]
than fortune-telling, stand[BR]

03-03A
[NEXT]
How tragic.[BR]
You do not have enough coins.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As my familial code states,[BR]
I can't predict your future[BR]
if you lack the funds.[BR]
I'm very sorry.[WAIT][END]

03-03B

03-03E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, it's you, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]What fortunate timing.[WAIT][END]

03-03F
[STYLE:RIGHT]I had a dream last night, and[BR]
another oracle spoke to me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Its voice was heavenly...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
"If you keep going around[BR]
and around the red palm tree[BR]
in the distant desert town[BR]
-- Dry Dry Outpost --[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
something good will happen."[BR]
So said the voice in my dream.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It doesn't seem to make any[BR]
sense at all to me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In fact, thinking about it[BR]
makes me so uneasy that I can't[BR]
sleep at night.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you find out what it means, [BR]
please tell me.[WAIT][END]

03-040
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hmmm...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
"Desert town, red palm tree,[BR]
go around and around,[BR]
something good will happen."[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What does the dream mean?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I can't get it out of my mind.[BR]
I can't sleep. I can't eat.[BR]
I'm obsessed![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Anyway, if you want me to[BR]
predict your future, talk to[BR]
me from across the table.[WAIT][END]

03-041
[STYLE:RIGHT]Huh...?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, this Badge is Quick Change![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I had no idea such a useful[BR]
Badge was in my attic...[BR]

Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]you are a very lucky man.[WAIT][END]

03-042
[STYLE:RIGHT]You should put that Badge on.[WAIT][END]
