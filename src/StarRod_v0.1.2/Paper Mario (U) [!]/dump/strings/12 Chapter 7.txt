12-01A

12-01B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hmm?[BR]

You're still our main suspect, so[BR]

named Herringway?[WAIT][END]

12-01E
[STYLE:RIGHT]What-what!?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Mayor Penguin was clutching a[BR]
piece of paper that had[BR]
"Herringway" written on it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bah! If that were true, I most[BR]

12-01F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hmmm... He definitely does[BR]
appear to be holding a piece[BR]
of paper.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Yes, of course![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's a message about his death![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
With his last breath, the Mayor[BR]
told us the murderer's identity![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]So... Mr. Herringway...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]You cold-hearted murderer![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It all makes sense now![BR]
[PAUSE:05]No wonder your novels are so[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
You live out your own plots![WAIT][END]

12-021
[STYLE:RIGHT]Dear man... [PAUSE:05]Do you have any idea[BR]
how ridiculous you sound?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]You actually think I would do this[BR]
to the Mayor?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's a great friend of mine![WAIT][END]

12-022
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mmmm... Yes...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Yes, you were good friends...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ah ha! But that was just a[BR]

crime![BR]

That's it, isn't it? I've solved[BR]
this crafty mystery![WAIT][END]

12-023
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, come on. Really.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You simple, simple penguin.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I would never be so predictable.[BR]

here to kill Mayor Penguin.[WAIT][END]

12-024
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'd just like to say that I still[BR]

is the murderer.[WAIT][END]

[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, yes, of course![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I reached up, slipped, and then[BR]
whacked my head on the floor.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Yes, that's what happened![WAIT][END]

12-02D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Here you are, Herringway.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This is what I was reaching for.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Toad Town was great fun.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]So many interesting sights... Wish[BR]

been murdered![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The whole city was up in arms![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Next time be more careful![WAIT][END]

12-030
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ah... [PAUSE:05]Yes. [PAUSE:05]So sorry.[WAIT][END]

12-031
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ha ha! I thought it rather [BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Besides, everything's OK now.[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Oh, you want to hike over to[BR]
Starborn Valley, do you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I see... Of course.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'll tell the gatekeeper to allow[BR]
you out of the city.[BR]

You'd better bundle up![WAIT][END]

12-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]Uh...I knew you were innocent the[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Ha ha ha ha ha...aaanyway...[WAIT][END]

12-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hi there! How are you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Herringway's mystery novels[BR]
have become very popular here in[BR]
Shiver City, you know.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But when I became a character[BR]
in a mystery, I realized that[BR]
I'm not so fond of books like[BR]
that.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm serious. I mean it.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Only penguin poetry for me now![WAIT][END]

12-037

[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm on your side. I want there to[BR]
be a happy ending![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Good luck![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Save the princess![WAIT][END]

12-039
[STYLE:RIGHT]Please come back anytime.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These northern lands aren't[BR]
much for scenery, but there's[BR]
always plenty of suspense![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ha ha! Only joking, only joking.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You'll always get a warm welcome[BR]
around here.[WAIT][END]

12-03A

Um... Oh, right! There was[BR]
something like that.[BR]

12-03C
[STYLE:RIGHT]This Bucket has been passed[BR]
down through the years in[BR]
Shiver City.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As Merle must have told you, [BR]
there's a legend associated with[BR]
it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you use this and the Scarf[BR]
together, the way to the Crystal[BR]
Palace will open.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Who knows what all that means,[BR]
though! Ha ha ha![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I don't have the slightest clue[BR]
as to how to use them together.[WAIT][END]

12-03D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Sounds like those Star Kids in[BR]
Starborn Valley are in trouble.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I hope you do your best for the[BR]
little tykes. They're just kids.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Best of luck to you![WAIT][END]

12-03E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Have you found the way to the[BR]
Crystal Palace yet?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh... No, huh? Boy, it must be[BR]
difficult being a famous[BR]
adventurer...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Poor Princess Peach...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If you can't save her, I don't[BR]
know who can![WAIT][END]

Crystal Palace!?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That's fantastic!![BR]

12-040
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, I do believe you've saved[BR]
all seven Star Spirits![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now all you have to do is defeat[BR]
Bowser and bring back the Star[BR]
Rod so that the world can be[BR]
peaceful again.[BR]

And all those poor, kidnapped[BR]
people can come back![BR]

It may sound simple, but it's[BR]

I was really worried there, and[BR]
all for nothing![BR]

At least it wasn't a complete[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]This way. [PAUSE:05]Please follow me.[WAIT][END]

12-0EC
[STYLE:RIGHT]I must apologize for the rude[BR]
reception of the Star Kids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
None of us expected that you'd[BR]
come here so quickly.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They frighten strangers to try[BR]

Bowser's followers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please...you must forgive them.[WAIT][END]

12-0ED
[STYLE:RIGHT]Come in, please.[WAIT][END]

12-0EE
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now. Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You must heed well what I'm[BR]
about to tell you.[WAIT][END]

12-0EF
[STYLE:RIGHT]This frozen area is called[BR]
Starborn Valley.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It is named this because it is[BR]
here that Stars are born and[BR]
raised before rising to the sky.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But now... Ever since Bowser[BR]
stole the Star Rod from Star[BR]
Haven...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The power of that place has[BR]
weakened and Star Kids have[BR]
found themselves unable to rise[BR]
up into the sky.[WAIT][END]

12-0F0
[STYLE:RIGHT]I sent a Ninji to my father,[BR]
Merlon, hoping that I could coax[BR]
you to come here...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Because I have found out where[BR]
the last Star Spirit is.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It came to me in a dream... A[BR]
vision of the last Star Spirit[BR]
begging me for help.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If my vision speaks truly, then[BR]
the last Star Spirit is being held[BR]
atop Shiver Mountain, which lies[BR]
to the north.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Up top sits the {Color:20}Crystal Palace{Color:0A}.[BR]
The Star Spirit waits there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Crystal Palace was originally[BR]
built to honor the Stars...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But as time passed, it slowly [BR]
faded from the memories of local[BR]
people...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...and now, no one can remember[BR]
how to reach the palace.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There is a way, though, and it[BR]
involves items that have been[BR]
passed down in these lands.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Here, take this.[WAIT][END]

12-0F1
[STYLE:RIGHT]This Scarf has been passed down[BR]
through many generations in[BR]
Starborn Valley.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wish I knew how to use it...[BR]
but I do not.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
According to the legends...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You must use this and another[BR]
item that has been passed down[BR]
in Shiver City[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
if you hope to open the way to[BR]
the Crystal Palace. Sadly,[BR]
that's all I know.[WAIT][END]

12-0F2
[STYLE:RIGHT]If things remain as they are,[BR]
Star Kids will never again be[BR]
able to rise to Star Haven.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Such a fate would be awful.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please! Help them! And expel[BR]
Bowser from the sky![WAIT][END]

12-0F3
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh yes... Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'd almost forgotten![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There is supposed to be a small[BR]
shrine somewhere along the path[BR]
to the Crystal Palace.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A legend has been handed down[BR]
in this valley regarding the[BR]
shrine's secret:[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
"Truth lies not only in the eyes.[BR]
Sometimes, even walls may lie."[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Confusing, yes, but you must[BR]
find this shrine and solve its[BR]
mystery to reach the Crystal[BR]
Palace.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please don't forget it![WAIT][END]

12-0F4
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mayor Penguin of Shiver City[BR]
should have the other vital item[BR]
you need. If you use it and the[BR]

Oh yes, I almost forgot! I need[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
I'd like you to take this letter[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
It's actually a reply to little[BR]
Goombaria, but I think her dad[BR]
