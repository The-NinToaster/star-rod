He said something about needing[BR]

...I remember him! Ever since he[BR]
was little, he's been able to fall[BR]
asleep anytime, anywhere.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It used to be impossible to wake[BR]
him up.[WAIT][END]

0C-018

I'm wishing to the Stars that she[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]That was my best shell![WAIT][END]

0C-01A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thanks, Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This shell [PAUSE:05]was made to order.[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Kent C. Koopa used to live in[BR]
this village.[BR]

Koopa Bros. Fortress.[BR]

Of course, things aren't much[BR]

The Fuzzies are running wild![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Poor little Bob-ombs...[BR]

Huh? Me?[BR]
[PAUSE:14]I don't leave my house because I[BR]
couldn't bear it if the Fuzzies[BR]
made a fool of me. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They'd probably take my shell[BR]
and play with it. I know I don't[BR]
look cool without my shell. Nope.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
No, thank you. I'd rather just[BR]
stay here and listen to music.[WAIT][END]

Good luck, all of you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'll be rooting for you![WAIT][END]

Maybe now our wishes will come[BR]
true again, and everything will[BR]

0C-060
[STYLE:RIGHT]Those Fuzzies were a real pain[BR]
in the shell, but it seems too[BR]
quiet without them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To be honest, I wouldn't mind if[BR]
they came by once in a while...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't tell anyone I said that.[WAIT][END]

He hasn't been back here to his[BR]

Then you won't have to.[BR]

[PAUSE:0F]Good luck, Mario![WAIT][END]

0C-06A
[STYLE:RIGHT]I put a high-tech lock on my shell[BR]

it. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They'll never manage to pry it[BR]
off me now! Ha ha![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm not sure if I can even get it[BR]
off, to be honest.[WAIT][END]

0C-06B
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Fuzzies are gone.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, I didn't hate them,[BR]
even though they were naughty.[WAIT][END]

0C-06C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, everybody's saying that[BR]
their wishes aren't coming true[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
It'd be awesome![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We've wanted our own house for[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
But [PAUSE:05]I guess we might have a[BR]

We could always go back to the[BR]
fortress, I suppose.[WAIT][END]

Of course not![WAIT][END]

southern island this time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He heard something about lots[BR]
of treasure stashed in a[BR]
volcano on the island[BR]
[PAUSE:05]and left shortly thereafter.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Pffff... He's obsessed![BR]
[PAUSE:14]He's like a spoiled little kid.[BR]
He always does what he wants.[BR]

Well... I suppose...[BR]

Mmmm...right, "Koopa Legends."[BR]
Yes, my husband owns that one.[BR]
Of course you can borrow it![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't let that old Koot work you[BR]
too hard, OK, Mario?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]He's known to do that. He's also[BR]
a bit short-tempered.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]

Go on, then! I found it on scenic[BR]
Lavalava Island.[WAIT][END]

That looks like... The subtle[BR]

mystery of the ruins![BR]

Good luck! Make some money![BR]

0C-0C3
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario! There you are![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I realized I have to take a[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
If I can't get my own shell,[BR]
I'll lose my reputation![BR]

I don't even care that I have[BR]

0C-0D9
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wondered what just fell,[BR]

Because I'm a menace![BR]
{Func_04}[WAIT][NEXT]
At least to these guys...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Those uncouth Koopa Bros.![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was just one of many Bob-ombs[BR]
working here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But those Koopa Bros....[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Once Bowser took over, they[BR]
started working us into the[BR]
ground![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I couldn't take it anymore, so I[BR]
exploded next to them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Yeah, that was a mistake.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]The Koopa Bros. didn't like it.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]So they locked me in here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And then they locked up the rest[BR]
of the Bob-ombs because they[BR]
thought they might rise up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, a Bob-omb rebellion![BR]
[PAUSE:05]What do you think about that?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03]Oh, sorry...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's a long story, I know.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Anyway, Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]we want to get out of here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think you could help spring[BR]
us from this place or what?[BR]
Pretty please?[BR]

If you help us...[BR]

Oh, you...won't...[BR]
[PAUSE:14]We're really hurting here, Mario.[BR]

out of here.[WAIT][END]

0C-0E0
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, gee, I almost forgot![BR]

I haven't even told you about[BR]

My specialty is exploding.[BR]

Let me try this one.[BR]

0C-0E2
[STYLE:RIGHT]See that?[BR]

{StartFX:Shrinking}Oh! An escape route![BR]

Well, I...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I guess I never thought about[BR]
doing that before...[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
And so can everyone else![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Thank you, Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
From now on I'll tag along and[BR]
help out wherever I can![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You just ask, and I'll be there[BR]

Before, they were just typical[BR]

They were nice enough.[BR]

0C-113
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}I have to go back now...[BR]
back to Star Haven.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I must leave immediately.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But I'll always be watching you![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Save us all, Mario![WAIT][END]

0C-114
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Now, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This is your gauge for Star[BR]
Energy.[WAIT][END]

0C-115
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}See? You can check to see how[BR]
much Star Energy you have.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
See how there's a star on the[BR]
right side of the gauge? Each[BR]
star marks one unit of Star[BR]
Energy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So, you have one unit now.[WAIT][END]

0C-116
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Next, allow me to explain about[BR]
Star Powers.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]First, let me tell you about[BR]
Refresh, all right?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This Power enables you to[BR]
restore five points of both HP[BR]
and FP at once.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Why don't you try out Refresh[BR]
right now?[WAIT][END]

0C-117
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}See? Both HP and FP have[BR]
recovered 5 points each.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You used one unit of Star[BR]
Energy, so you're empty now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Watch your Star Energy gauge[BR]
carefully during battle.[WAIT][END]

0C-118
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Usually, your partner's turn[BR]
would come next, and then[BR]
it would be your enemy's turn.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But we're just practicing now, [BR]
so let's assume it's Mario's[BR]
turn again. [WAIT][END]

0C-119
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}OK. It's Mario's turn.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now, pay attention to the Star[BR]
Energy gauge![WAIT][END]

0C-11A
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Did you notice that the amount[BR]
of Star Energy increased a[BR]
little bit?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Star Energy increases little by[BR]
little every time it comes around[BR]
to Mario's turn. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Remember this, because it'll[BR]
become very important![WAIT][END]

0C-11B
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Next, I'm going to teach you[BR]
about another Star Power:[BR]
Focus.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Focus is a Star Power that [BR]
enables you to increase Star[BR]
Energy a little more than usual[BR]
during a turn.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Right now, your Star Energy is[BR]
almost empty, even though you're[BR]
slowly refilling it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
All right, try the Star Power[BR]
Focus now. [WAIT][END]

0C-11C
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Did you notice how much the[BR]
Star Energy increased?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Focus helps you increase your[BR]
Star Energy much more quickly.[WAIT][END]

0C-11D
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}You should also remember that[BR]
you can replenish your Star[BR]
Energy by taking a nap at a[BR]
Toad House.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, that wraps up my[BR]
explanation![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I earnestly wish that you'll[BR]
make good use of these Star[BR]
Powers during battle.[WAIT][END]

0C-11E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hold it right there, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I've been waiting for you!![WAIT][END]

0C-11F
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}I told you I'd be back! Now I'll[BR]
get my revenge![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Here it comes, baby![BR]
Check this out![WAIT][END]

0C-120
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Dwaaaahhhhhh![BR]
[PAUSE:0F][END]

0C-121
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario! I'm talking to you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I promise you, this fight will be[BR]
much different from before![WAIT][END]

0C-122
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey...you're Jr. Troopa![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Are you following us?[BR]
You need to mellow out![WAIT][END]

0C-123
[STYLE:RIGHT]Who is this crazed guy?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What a nut... [WAIT][END]

0C-124
[STYLE:RIGHT]Who's this kid...?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let me get this straight...[BR]
He wants to challenge you?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's got to be kidding![WAIT][END]

0C-125
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Shut up!!!!![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You! Mario!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Of course you remember me!?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

0C-126
[NEXT]
That's right! Darn tootin'![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm Jr.Troopa![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This time, you're really gonna[BR]
see some fireworks![WAIT][END]

0C-127
[NEXT]
Whaaaat! Darn it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You don't remember me?![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Listen, you...you big lug![BR]
[PAUSE:05]My name is Jr. Troopa![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Remember it and tremble![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
After this beating, you'll[BR]
definitely remember it![WAIT][END]

0C-128
[STYLE:RIGHT]Get ready to hurt, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm gonna show you a new skill I[BR]
just picked up![WAIT][END]

0C-129
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yeah! Check that out![BR]
[PAUSE:05]You've never seen anything like[BR]
it before, have you? [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Your attacks are useless now!![WAIT][END]

0C-12A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yeeowch!![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Who knew that Mario had such[BR]
battle skills?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{Func_04}Grrr...it's not over yet, though![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]{StartFX:Shrinking}Yaaaaaaaahhh!!!!![WAIT][END]

0C-12B
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Wavy}Aaaaaaaaaaaah![WAIT][END]

0C-12C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, you in the hat! Wait![WAIT][END]

0C-12D
[STYLE:RIGHT]It's fine weather, isn't it?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]My name is Kent C. Koopa.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Please remember it, OK?[BR]
[PAUSE:14][WAIT][NEXT]
If you want to use this road,[BR]
you need to pay me 100 coins.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]So sorry, but that's how it is.[BR]
You don't pay, you don't pass.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Coins make the world go round.[BR]
It's all about the money![BR]
{Func_04}[END]

0C-12E
[NEXT]
You want to fight? You're nuts![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Look at me! I'll cream you![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Because, to be frank, I'm very,[BR]
very, very strong.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Are you sure you want to fight?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

0C-12F
[NEXT]
Oh, you don't have any coins?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Then you can't go through.[WAIT][END]

0C-130
[STYLE:RIGHT]Bring some coins next time.[WAIT][END]

0C-131
[NEXT]
Then you can't go through here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Tough luck. Take off.[WAIT][END]

0C-132
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, you changed your mind, and[BR]
now you'll pay the coins?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

0C-133
[STYLE:RIGHT]Good doing business with you![BR]
[PAUSE:14]Oh, the jingle of coins is so very[BR]
beautiful.[WAIT][END]

0C-134
[STYLE:RIGHT]Here, go ahead.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]See you again sometime![WAIT][END]

0C-135
[NEXT]
Well, I have no choice...[BR]
I warned you, though.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This may hurt a little bit...[WAIT][END]

0C-136
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wow. You must be really strong.[BR]
I mean, beating a guy my size?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess I have to give up.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]See you later...[WAIT][END]
