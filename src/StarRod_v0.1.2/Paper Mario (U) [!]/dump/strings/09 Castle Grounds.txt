[STYLE:RIGHT]I can't believe that Princess[BR]
Peach's Castle was here just a [BR]
little while ago. Wow![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was in the castle when it [BR]
started to shake, but my [BR]
lightning-quick feet got me out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I know Luigi made it out along[BR]
with maybe a few others...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But everyone else was taken.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]You don't know how happy I am[BR]
that you made it, Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you weren't in the mix, I[BR]
don't know what kind of chance[BR]
we'd have.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm rooting for you, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You've got to save the princess[BR]
and everyone else![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]How depressing... Nothing but a[BR]
big hole where there was once a[BR]
beautiful castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The garden... Ruined.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Why do I torture myself by[BR]
coming here all the time?[BR]
I just can't help it.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]To think! When the castle was[BR]
here, it was always bustling.[BR]
Now no one walks here...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't believe it, but I[BR]
actually miss the crowds...[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Sometimes I feel confident that[BR]
the castle will be back here soon[BR]
and that these days will seem[BR]
like a dark dream.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Pure fantasy, perhaps.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But that doesn't stop me from[BR]
wishing from the bottom of my[BR]
heart that it'll happen someday.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Even now, I still take walks to[BR]
Shooting Star Summit.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have so many beautiful[BR]
memories of trekking up there[BR]
to see the Stars.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now, though... Now we can't see[BR]
any stars at all.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How I miss them...[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]I beg of you, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Save all those poor captives[BR]
in the castle![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]You're Muss T., correct?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The name's Parakarry.[BR]
I deliver letters.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I believe I have one for you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hang on a moment.[WAIT][END]

09-011
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...no! Confound it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I seem to have lost it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]...I'm terribly sorry.[WAIT][END]

09-012
[STYLE:RIGHT]Another letter, duly received.[BR]
A postman's job is never done.[WAIT][END]

09-013
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, it's from Mr. Goompapa.[BR]
That old codger![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We think alike, he and I.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's been ages since I saw him.[BR]
Too long, indeed![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This reminds me... I was just[BR]
thinking about sending a letter[BR]
to one of my other friends.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Your timing is perfect.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This letter is to my friend.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
His name is Koover, and he lives[BR]
in Koopa Village. I'd like you[BR]
to deliver this to him.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll bet he's near the entrance[BR]
to the village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He usually hangs out in front[BR]
of the Toad House that's right[BR]
on the edge of town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
No big rush, but it would be[BR]
nice if he got it soon.[WAIT][END]
