ordinary Goombas.[WAIT][END]

notorious Goomba Bros.[BR]

He has just a little more HP[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Everybody knows Koopa Troopas.[BR]
They're Bowser's followers.[BR]

Their shells are hard.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you can flip 'em over,[BR]
their defense power will fall[BR]

easier for you to defeat 'em.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can flip 'em with a POW[BR]
Block or a Jump attack. [WAIT][END]

1C-008
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Paratroopa.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]No surprise here--Paratroopas[BR]
are Koopa Troopas with wings.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 1,[BR]
Defense Power: 1[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you jump on 'em or use a[BR]
POW Block, their wings fall[BR]
off and they become normal[BR]
Koopa Troopas.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's easy to beat 'em once[BR]
they're normal Koopa Troopas.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Give 'em another Jump attack![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They think they're pretty cool[BR]
because they wear sunglasses,[BR]
but they're not that tough.[WAIT][END]

1C-009
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Fuzzy.[BR]

up and down? They need to[BR]
chill out![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 1,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The problem with Fuzzies is their[BR]
quickness. It's really tough to[BR]
time their attacks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If they latch on to you, watch[BR]
out! They'll absorb your HP.[WAIT][END]

1C-00A
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Bob-omb.[BR]

Bob-ombs are pretty[BR]
temperamental, [BR]

when you attack 'em.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 3, Attack Power: 1,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'd better not jump on 'em[BR]
when they're angry or they'll[BR]
blow up in your face.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]In fact, stay away entirely.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Attack 'em from a distance with[BR]
items like Hammers.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Or you could send in other[BR]
things, like shells.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If they attack when angry,[BR]
they'll charge in and explode.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]So you'd better take care of [BR]
them before they blow![WAIT][END]

1C-00B
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Bullet Bill, [BR]
a kamikaze attacker.[BR]

If you don't beat Bullet Bills[BR]

and explode.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 2, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm serious, Mario. These guys[BR]
will really make us pay if they[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
We have to beat 'em before they[BR]
get the chance to strike us.[WAIT][END]

that shoot out Bullet Bills.[BR]

Defense Power: 1[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They won't attack us directly,[BR]
but they'll keep shooting out[BR]
Bullet Bills as long as they can.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's efficient to attack 'em [BR]
all at once, but you can also [BR]
beat 'em one at a time.[WAIT][END]

1C-00D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Bowser...?[BR]

He has a little bit of defense[BR]

a battle?[BR]

Max HP: 5, Attack Power: 1,[BR]

They do a spinning attack[BR]
with the whole gang piled[BR]
high atop one another.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hit 'em with a Hammer or[BR]
something to make 'em unstable.[BR]
After that, any attack should [BR]
knock 'em down.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you use an explosion, you[BR]
can make 'em fall down at once.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you flip 'em over, the battle[BR]
will nearly be ours![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Beat 'em one by one![WAIT][END]

1C-013

Ugh. They have kind of scary[BR]
looking faces.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They're pretty weak, though.[BR]

sensitive eyes.[BR]

you'd better be careful.[BR]

Their specialty is pretending[BR]
to be rocks, so watch your step[BR]
on the mountain.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'll get hurt if you jump[BR]
on the spikes on their heads.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, there's courage in[BR]
running away sometimes...[WAIT][END]

1C-016

They can steal up to 10 coins. [BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
They'll slyly approach and then[BR]
slam into you all of a sudden.[BR]

If you can damage them in[BR]
an attack, you can get your[BR]
stolen coins back.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's beat 'em before they[BR]
can make off with our loot![WAIT][END]

1C-018

Careful! They have spikes on[BR]
their heads![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Trust me--it'll hurt if you[BR]
jump on 'em.[BR]

The mummification also made[BR]
'em poisonous. If you get[BR]
poisoned when they attack you,[BR]
you'll take damage for a while.[BR]

What do you say we beat 'em[BR]
before they can poison us?[WAIT][END]

1C-019

Fire attacks don't work very[BR]
well against these hardheads.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you can flip 'em, though,[BR]
their defense power falls to 0.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Keep flipping 'em, Mario![BR]

I heard that they used to[BR]
flourish all over the place, but[BR]

shadowy places.[WAIT][END]

1C-01A

Even Jump attacks can't reach[BR]
'em when they're hanging on[BR]
the ceiling, but earth tremors[BR]
will knock 'em loose.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Parakarry can also knock 'em[BR]

You can attack 'em however[BR]
you choose once they're[BR]
hovering in the air.[WAIT][END]

If you get caught in the[BR]
clutches of his sharp claws,[BR]
you'll lose 4 HP![BR]
Try to wriggle out of his grip.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
His special attack is flapping[BR]
his wings to create wind.[BR]
This attack damages your[BR]
party members, too.[BR]

He attacks by throwing shells[BR]

Try to dodge when he uses[BR]
magic: its attack power is 2[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:05]And he also summons Chomps,[BR]
his loyal subjects.[BR]

Think hard about who to attack [BR]
first, Tutankoopa or Chomp.[WAIT][END]

They're made of such hard[BR]
stuff that most of your[BR]

I heard a rumor that the[BR]
Chomps are a little peeved at[BR]
Tutankoopa because he works[BR]
them so hard.[WAIT][END]

You've seen 'em in every one[BR]
of your adventures, so I imagine[BR]

Their sharp jaws point upward,[BR]
so you'll get bitten if you try[BR]

They smile after biting people.[BR]

uncivilized Goombas living[BR]

They sometimes charge their[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
That charged attack will take[BR]

It's a good idea to use Bow or[BR]

The attack will miss for sure.[WAIT][END]

It'll miss you if you can[BR]

they have spikes up top![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It'll hurt if you jump on 'em.[WAIT][END]

They often sleep on the job.[BR]
If you walk very slowly,[BR]

the action command perfectly,[BR]
they're not so tough.[WAIT][END]

I'd say it's a good idea to[BR]
run from immortal enemies![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If you get in deep trouble, Bow[BR]

Be careful, because I'm not[BR]

Apparently he's grown wings,[BR]

Big time rascals. No good...  [BR]

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They occasionally do acrobatic[BR]
attacks that have an attack[BR]
power of 3.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Who knows what lies in the[BR]
hearts of these troublemakers?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I guess they're dangerous, but[BR]
they're pretty small time.[WAIT][END]

1C-02A
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Groove Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Groove Guys wear weird clothes.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]They're probably stage clothes.[BR]
Pssh... You know performers...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They shake their booties to[BR]
call in reinforcements.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]They also spin around in front[BR]
of you and make you feel dizzy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These rock 'n' rollers are a[BR]
drag, so let's ditch 'em as[BR]
fast as we can.[WAIT][END]

1C-02B
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Spy Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Spy Guys look like they're[BR]
ready for war in their spiffy[BR]
camouflage gear![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They change their weapons each[BR]
time they're attacked.[BR]

You'd best try to avoid their[BR]
hammer attack! Every time[BR]
you're hit by it, you'll lose[BR]
one of your commands![WAIT][END]

1C-02C
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Pyro Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Pyro Guys are on fire, so any[BR]
contact with them will cause[BR]
damage.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 4,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're tough opponents, mainly[BR]
because their attack power is[BR]
so high.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Any attacks that involve water[BR]
or snow are our best bet[BR]
because...well...you know.[WAIT][END]

1C-02D
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Sky Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Sky Guys are master balloonists.[BR]

We can attack the balloon, too.[BR]

I wish I had a balloon so I could[BR]
float... That looks awesome![WAIT][END]

1C-02E
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Medi Guy.[BR]

workers of the Shy Guy clan.[BR]

Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 1,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have the power to heal[BR]
their wounded companions.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Of course, they also attack.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We'd better hurry up and take[BR]
them out of the mix. It's a[BR]
pain if they keep fixing all[BR]
the damage we do.[WAIT][END]

1C-02F
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is an Anti Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]His attacks are so intense that[BR]
he's also called Deadly Guy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 10,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
His attack power is 12[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
This guy is for real, so we'd[BR]
better take him seriously.[WAIT][END]

1C-030
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Big Lantern Ghost.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He avoids attacks by hiding[BR]
in the dark.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]

Hit the Lantern many times[BR]

As soon as you can see, hit[BR]
him right in the head![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]This is General Guy in his tank.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The tank seems to be dangerous[BR]
even though it's a toy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 30, Attack Power: 4,[BR]
Defense Power: 2[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Not only does the General give[BR]
commands from the tank, but he[BR]
also throws bombs and uses[BR]
electric attacks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The power of his electric[BR]
attack is 5, and your party[BR]
member takes 2 damage points,[BR]
so defend yourself carefully.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He'll lose the electric attack[BR]
if we break the light bulb.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Normal fighting styles seem[BR]
ineffective because the tank[BR]
is well fortified.[WAIT][END]

1C-032
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is the Shy Squad.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It'll attack us with all [BR]
its members at once.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 15, Attack Power: 1,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The number of times we're [BR]
attacked will equal the number [BR]
of Shy Guys in the Squad.  [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Its attack power is huge when[BR]
there are many Guys, but it [BR]
drops for each one that falls. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's use an attack that does[BR]
tons of damage so we can[BR]
decrease their numbers and[BR]
increase our chances![WAIT][END]

1C-033
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Shy Stack.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Whoa, this pile has an[BR]
incredible sense of balance![BR]
Look at that stack![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 1,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Its attack power equals the [BR]
number of Guys in the stack.  [BR]
It will be 4 if there are four [BR]
Shy Guys stacked up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you have the Spin Hammer[BR]
ability, you can knock 'em[BR]
off one by one.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Obviously, their attack power[BR]
decreases when there are fewer[BR]
of 'em in the stack.[WAIT][END]

1C-034
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is Stilt Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Yes, as the name suggests, [BR]
Stilt Guys are Shy Guys on[BR]
Stilts.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean, it seems pretty obvious[BR]
to me...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 4,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you attack 'em by shaking[BR]
the ground, they'll fall off[BR]
their stilts and become[BR]
normal Shy Guys.[WAIT][END]

1C-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Hurt Plant.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hurt Plants pretend to be [BR]
Heart Plants, which give you[BR]
a Heart when you touch them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If a Hurt Plant bites you,[BR]
you'll be poisoned.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Then your HP will slowly[BR]
fall with each turn.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We'd better beat 'em as quickly[BR]
as possible.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Unless you can frequently[BR]
restore your HP, you'll find[BR]
yourself in trouble pretty fast.[WAIT][END]

1C-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is an M. Bush.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]M. Bushes pretend to be bushes[BR]
and wait for unwary prey. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 8, Attack Power: 3,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their bites are sometimes[BR]
poisonous, so be careful.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you get poisoned, your HP[BR]
will gradually fall.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Your situation could become[BR]
critical unless you restore[BR]
your HP as soon as possible.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's clear 'em out quickly,[BR]
OK? Use your most powerful[BR]
attack, why don't you?[WAIT][END]

1C-037
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Jungle Fuzzy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Jungle Fuzzies are very similar[BR]
to other Fuzzies, but they live[BR]
in the jungle, so...[BR]
...that's their name.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They cling to you, suck out[BR]
your HP and add it to their own.[BR]
What a sleazy move![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They won't stop clinging to you[BR]
unless you tear 'em off[BR]
with the action command.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They also occasionally divide,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]so let's beat 'em before they[BR]
get the chance.[WAIT][END]

1C-038
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Spear Guy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Spear Guys are relatives of[BR]
Shy Guys. They live in the[BR]
jungle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 7, Attack Power: 3,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'll get hurt if you attack[BR]
with the Hammer while they're[BR]
pointing the spear at you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'll also get hurt if you[BR]
try to jump on 'em when the[BR]
spear's pointing upward.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Pay attention to the position[BR]
of their spears when we attack.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh yeah, they also sometimes[BR]
call in reinforcements.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]After they throw their spears,[BR]
they become ordinary Shy Guys.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Putrid Piranha.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 3,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Putrid Piranhas sometimes bite,[BR]
but the truly scary thing is[BR]
their nasty, poisonous breath.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The power of their bad breath[BR]
is 2, but your HP will begin[BR]
to fall if you get poisoned.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You should try to recover as[BR]
quickly as possible if you[BR]
get poisoned.[WAIT][END]

1C-03A
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Lava Bubble, a fire[BR]
ball monster.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Lava Bubbles live near lava.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 9, Attack Power: 4,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They are obviously pretty hot,[BR]
so you'll get hurt if you try[BR]
to jump on 'em.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They sometimes attack your[BR]
friends (like me!), too.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The power of that attack is 2.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Because of their fiery nature,[BR]
they fear snow and water.[WAIT][END]

1C-03B
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is Spike Top.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Spike Tops have spikes on top.[BR]
Duh![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 4, Attack Power: 3,[BR]
Defense Power: 4[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're tough, just like Buzzy[BR]
Beetles, and fire attacks[BR]
don't affect 'em at all.[BR]

But their defense power drops[BR]
if you can flip 'em over.[WAIT][END]

1C-03C
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Lava Piranha.[BR]

Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 5,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since their bodies are on fire,[BR]
you'll take damage if you step[BR]
on 'em.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't worry if you're fireproof.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They'll try to burn you with[BR]
their fire breath.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're creatures born of fire,[BR]
so water attacks will work[BR]
extremely well against them.[WAIT][END]

1C-03E
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Lava Bud.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Lava Buds are little flowers[BR]
branching out from the main[BR]
stem of the Lava Piranha.[BR]
They love it in the lava.[BR]

Hey, if you were a fiery plant,[BR]
you'd love it in there, too.[BR]

[PAUSE:05]This kid...he's got guts![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 40, Attack Power: 6,[BR]
Defense Power: 1[BR]

He still flies but now he has[BR]
a spike on his head. It'll hurt[BR]
if you jump on him.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He seems tougher this time...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Luckily for us, he also looks[BR]
pretty tuckered out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, he should be tired.[BR]
The little guy swam to[BR]
Lavalava Island and back![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems better to attack[BR]
from a distance with an item[BR]
or something, rather than[BR]
attacking him directly.[WAIT][END]

1C-042
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Lakitu.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Lakitus are strange Koopas[BR]
that can ride clouds.[BR]

Max HP: 12, Attack Power: 3,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They toss down Spiny Eggs,[BR]

into crawling Spinies.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We'd better deal with them[BR]
quickly or else we'll be[BR]
surrounded by Spinies.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems like these Lakitus[BR]
have been hassling you for[BR]
your entire career, Mario.[WAIT][END]

1C-043

[PAUSE:0A]Spinies have spikes on their[BR]
shells that are pretty sharp.[BR]

They'll roll into Spiny Eggs[BR]

It'll be much easier to fight[BR]
them if you can flip them over.[BR]
Their defense power falls to 0.[WAIT][END]

If they sting you, sometimes[BR]
you'll be poisoned.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They also occasionally call a[BR]
swarm of small bees to attack[BR]
you in a cloud.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Be careful of those little[BR]
attackers, because you'll[BR]
sometimes shrink when stung. [BR]

They don't have a lot of HP,[BR]
so take care of 'em as quick[BR]

you won't think they're so[BR]
cute after they attack you![BR]

Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They attack by singing a song.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If you fall under the song's[BR]
spell, you'll fall asleep.[BR]

If you get their HP low enough,[BR]
they'll try to run away. Beat[BR]

Max HP: 20, Attack Power: 20,[BR]

These guys almost always flee[BR]

pack a powerful punch![WAIT][END]

1C-047

Mt. Rugged, don't you?[BR]

Max HP: 50, Attack Power: 4,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]

Lakilester? What an odd guy...[BR]

his real name is...[WAIT][END]

1C-049
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Ruff Puff.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Ruff Puffs are nasty little[BR]
cloud henchmen of Huff N. Puff.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 10, Attack Power: 4,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ruff Puffs float in the air,[BR]
so a Jump attack or something[BR]
similar may be best.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, I'd be more than[BR]
happy to give 'em a Headbonk![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's your call, Mario.[WAIT][END]

1C-04A

Max HP: 60, Attack Power: 5,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]

His thunder attack is very[BR]
dangerous. If you don't defend,[BR]
you'll take massive damage.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you attack Huff N. Puff,[BR]
little clouds called Tuff Puffs[BR]
come out. Their number is based[BR]
on the amount of damage you do.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you leave the Tuff Puffs,[BR]
Huff N. Puff will swallow[BR]
them up and restore his HP.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You need to use smart tactics[BR]
to beat this guy, Mario.[WAIT][END]

1C-04B
[STYLE:RIGHT]These are the Tuff Puffs that[BR]
break off when you damage[BR]
Huff N. Puff.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Max HP: 1, Attack Power: 2,[BR]
Defense Power: 0[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Tuff Puffs will fly over and[BR]
attack you directly.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You have to shake them off you[BR]
using the action command or[BR]
they'll keep on damaging you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Huff N. Puff will swallow[BR]
the Tuff Puffs to restore[BR]
his HP, so think carefully[BR]
when attacking.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can beat the Tuff Puffs[BR]
easily by attacking all enemies.[WAIT][END]

Gulpits attack by picking rocks[BR]
up in their mouths and then[BR]
spitting 'em back out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The bigger the rock they spit,[BR]
the more damage you'll take.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Big rocks take 7 HP in damage,[BR]
and small ones take 5 HP.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They can't do much damage[BR]
without ammo, so you should[BR]
concentrate on the rocks first.[WAIT][END]

1C-04E
[STYLE:RIGHT]These are Gulpits' Rocks. Gulpits[BR]
gulp them and then spit 'em at[BR]
people.[BR]

had a nightmare about it...[BR]

You'll be at their mercy if[BR]
they freeze you, so you'd[BR]

Ice attacks won't work--[BR]
they love ice![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Fire attacks, though...[WAIT][END]

1C-051

They sometimes attack[BR]

Its disguise is pretty much[BR]

character it's imitating.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's probably not very difficult[BR]
for this Duplighost to disguise[BR]
itself as Kooper. After all, our[BR]
pal is pretty unusual looking.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It'll attack us with its shell,[BR]

You'll have the best luck[BR]
beating it if you flip it.[WAIT][END]

You can't jump high enough[BR]

An earthquake attack ought[BR]
to work, though.[BR]

Flying party members, like[BR]
Bow or Parakarry, can also[BR]

If they fall and begin to flap[BR]

jumping as well.[WAIT][END]

The power of each attack is 4.[BR]
The number of times he[BR]
attacks equals the number of[BR]

You can hurt him only by[BR]
attacking his real body.[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Pretty brilliant, eh?[WAIT][END]

1C-05E
[STYLE:RIGHT]I think this is a deceptive[BR]

Their Max HP is 1 and they're[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
They divide themselves when[BR]
they're attacked.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Keep attacking 'em, though.[BR]
You'll get 'em eventually.[BR]

They'll probably fight back.[BR]

beat, these guys rise back up[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
You're going to have to beat[BR]
them all at once.[BR]

Or you could use fire attacks.[BR]
If they become ashes, there's[BR]
no way they'll recover.[WAIT][END]

they'll charge up power for[BR]

Be careful of that hammer![BR]
If it hits you, you'll get[BR]

When the Hammer Bros. get[BR]

These guys have been a pain for[BR]

And nobody wants that.[WAIT][END]

He's strong enough as it is,[BR]

Fire Attack: 10,[BR]
Stamp Attack/Nail Attack: 8[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure he has other attacks[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Kammy Koopa's mysterious[BR]
device has somehow beefed up[BR]
his power even more.[BR]
That's hardly fair![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You should use that Star Beam[BR]
whenever he uses the Star Rod[BR]
to increase his power.[BR]
Oh, you already knew that?[WAIT][END]

I'm sure he has other attacks[BR]

When he increases his power[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
When that happens, you must[BR]
use our ultimate weapon, the[BR]
Peach Beam! It has the power[BR]

This is our time, Mario![BR]
Let's take this chump![BR]

He sometimes does a stamp[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
His shell attack also damages[BR]
party members (like me!), [BR]
so be sure to defend![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As with all Koopas, your[BR]
chances will greatly improve[BR]
if you can flip him over.[BR]
His defense power will drop.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Watch it, though! He'll attack[BR]
as soon as he's back on his feet.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And by the way, is he not [BR]
THE HUGEST KOOPA EVER!?![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Somebody told me that he used[BR]

A bit of advice: When they're[BR]
emitting electricity, it'd[BR]
be a smart move to avoid[BR]
contact with 'em.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you can manage to damage[BR]
'em while they're emitting[BR]

Their attack power when they're[BR]
emitting electricity is 6. [BR]

what do you say?[WAIT][END]

Trust me, its size doesn't lie.[BR]
It's pretty powerful.[BR]

And sometimes it spawns[BR]
Blooper Babies.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Buckle down, Mario![BR]
We're in for a fight![WAIT][END]

Hammer attacks don't work well,[BR]

No mercy, Mario![WAIT][END]

Be extra careful when you see[BR]

they're getting ready to do[BR]
their dizzy attack.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Their defense power is 0 [BR]

Hammer attacks won't work[BR]

They'll lose their wings if[BR]
