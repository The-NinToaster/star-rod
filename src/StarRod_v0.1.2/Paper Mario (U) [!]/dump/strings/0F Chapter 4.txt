[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, there's a track problem![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We can't go that direction.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you see that lever way behind[BR]
us on the left? If you can get[BR]
over there and push it, we'll be[BR]
able to continue.[WAIT][END]

0F-013
[STYLE:RIGHT]I think our little track problem[BR]
will be fixed if you pull down on[BR]
that lever.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Or maybe not. I'm not sure...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hmmm...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]To pull or not to pull?[WAIT][END]

0F-014
[STYLE:RIGHT]Do you think pulling that lever[BR]
will fix the tracks?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hmmm...[WAIT][END]

0F-015
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well, I'll be![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Just as I suspected![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We should have moved that lever[BR]
a long time ago![WAIT][END]

0F-016
[STYLE:RIGHT]We can't go to Red Station. [BR]
The tracks are broken, see?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm very sorry...[WAIT][END]

0F-017
[STYLE:RIGHT]Usually I work here at Blue[BR]
Station.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But since there's no train, I'm[BR]
pretty much unemployed now.[WAIT][END]

0F-018
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Storeroom Key you have in[BR]
your hand... I'm positive the[BR]
Shy Guys stole that from[BR]
somewhere in Toad Town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder who they stole it from.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Whoever it was must be mad.[WAIT][END]

0F-019
[STYLE:RIGHT]You gave the Storeroom Key back[BR]
to the storekeeper?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He must've been super happy![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Happier than I am, anyway.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's still no train, so I still[BR]
don't have a job.[WAIT][END]

0F-01A
[STYLE:RIGHT]The train's running again![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We can leave anytime!![WAIT][END]

0F-01B
[STYLE:RIGHT]That Frying Pan you have in[BR]
your hand... I'm positive the[BR]
Shy Guys stole that from[BR]
somewhere in Toad Town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure whoever owned it must[BR]
be all broken up right now.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You can't cook very well without[BR]
a Frying Pan.[WAIT][END]

0F-01C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Did you know that Shy Guys[BR]
really like sweets?[BR]
Cakes, candies...you name it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Supposedly, that's all they'd eat[BR]
if they could.[WAIT][END]

0F-01D
[STYLE:RIGHT]You can repair all of the broken[BR]
rails along our route by moving[BR]
nearby levers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Obviously, we're going nowhere if[BR]
the rails don't get fixed.[WAIT][END]

0F-01E
[STYLE:RIGHT]You can repair all of the broken[BR]
rails along our route by moving[BR]
nearby levers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Or maybe not all of them...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What do we do...?[WAIT][END]

0F-01F
[STYLE:RIGHT]That Memo you have is written in[BR]
Shy Guy language.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't look at me! I can't read[BR]
Shy Guy language![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You could probably figure it out[BR]
if you found someone who's smart[BR]
enough.[WAIT][END]

0F-020
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, thanks a lot for figuring[BR]
out the secret of the[BR]
jack-in-the-box switch.[BR]
Now the train can roll again.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Nothing makes me happier than[BR]
watching the train roll...[WAIT][END]

0F-021
[STYLE:RIGHT]Rumor is that there's a vehicle[BR]
very similar to this in the world[BR]
outside the box.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They call it a train, too...?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well...there's no way it can be as[BR]
cool as our train...[WAIT][END]

0F-022
[STYLE:RIGHT]It seems as though those Shy[BR]
Guys have learned a lesson this[BR]
time. Maybe they won't steal[BR]
things anymore.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They ought to just learn to live[BR]
in peace, surrounded by toys![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A hand holding a toy is less[BR]
likely to cause mischief...[WAIT][END]

0F-023
[STYLE:RIGHT]Some Shy Guy just ran off to[BR]
the right with a Frying Pan![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ooh, I just bet that he stole it[BR]
from some innocent soul![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]And you know he doesn't really[BR]
want to cook anything with it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Shy Guys are so obnoxious...[WAIT][END]

0F-024
[STYLE:RIGHT]Have you seen the Gourmet Guy?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He's a huge Shy Guy who's really[BR]
particular about food.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Judging by his size, I'd say he's[BR]
not all that particular.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He has a serious sweet tooth. I[BR]
hear that he really loves Cake.[WAIT][END]

0F-025
[STYLE:RIGHT]We have to move some lever in[BR]
order to repair the tracks so[BR]
we can go to Green Station.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think it was that pink lever[BR]
over there, but...I'm not sure...[BR]
I forget...[WAIT][END]

0F-026
[STYLE:RIGHT]We have to move some lever in[BR]
order to repair the tracks so[BR]
we can go to Green Station.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think it was that pink lever[BR]
over there, but...I'm not sure...[BR]
I forget...[WAIT][END]

0F-027
[STYLE:RIGHT]The tracks are all fixed, so we[BR]
can now go to Green Station.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Feel free to use this train[BR]
anytime you like![WAIT][END]

0F-028
[STYLE:RIGHT]Have you seen the Big Lantern[BR]
Ghost?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He always hides in gloomy places.[BR]
He loves the darkness.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Then again, he's always carrying[BR]
this little lantern, so...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...maybe he doesn't like the[BR]
darkness all that much...[WAIT][END]

0F-029
[STYLE:RIGHT]I heard that the Big Lantern[BR]
Ghost took off.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Do you think he left the box?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He won't need that lantern if he[BR]
lives somewhere bright.[WAIT][END]

0F-02A
[STYLE:RIGHT]You know, Shy Guys made this Toy[BR]
Train that we use.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They like to gather worn-out[BR]
things that no one uses and turn[BR]
them into toys.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're pretty good at making[BR]
something out of nothing.[WAIT][END]

0F-02B
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is Green Station.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm certainly feeling green.[BR]
Shy Guys hid our tracks![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How're we supposed to move?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, by the way, a Shy Guy with a[BR]
book ran off to the right toward[BR]
the Slot Machine.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure the little rogue stole[BR]
that book from someone.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It'll be impossible to catch him[BR]
unless you figure out how to get[BR]
through the wire fence.[WAIT][END]

0F-02C
[STYLE:RIGHT]I witnessed a Shy Guy with a[BR]
book running to the right,[BR]
toward the Slot Machine.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure the little rogue stole[BR]
that book from someone.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It'll be impossible to catch him[BR]
unless you figure out how to get[BR]
through the wire fence.[WAIT][END]

0F-02D
[STYLE:RIGHT]That Memo you have is written in[BR]
Shy Guy language.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't look at me! I can't read[BR]
Shy Guy language![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You could probably figure it out[BR]
if you found someone who's smart[BR]
enough.[WAIT][END]

0F-02E
[STYLE:RIGHT]We can go to Red Station now![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Great! Feel free to ride with[BR]
us anytime![WAIT][END]

0F-02F
[STYLE:RIGHT]It looks like the Shy Guys are[BR]
really robbing Toad Town blind.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've heard them say that they[BR]
want Bowser to reward them for[BR]
filling up this Toy Box.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It used to be so peaceful inside[BR]
here...but it's getting downright[BR]
crowded and noisy.[WAIT][END]

0F-030
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm sure the Shy Guys are going[BR]
to knock it off for a while.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They'll recover eventually,[BR]
though, and start gathering[BR]
worn-out junk again for their[BR]
toy-making needs.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Everyone's much happier when[BR]
they only take worn-out stuff[BR]
instead of precious items.[WAIT][END]

0F-031
[STYLE:RIGHT]The other day, I saw a gang of[BR]
Shy Guys carrying a sparkling[BR]
card of some sort in a cage.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They headed off to the right...[BR]
Do you think I ought to go check[BR]
out what they were doing?[WAIT][END]

0F-032
[STYLE:RIGHT]You beat that weird, giggling[BR]
ghost that likes the dark?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Wow, that's great! Thank you![WAIT][END]

0F-033
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh. I see. The Shy Guys were[BR]
holding a Star Spirit...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I thought they were happy just[BR]
making and playing with toys.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Who could want more?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Anyway, our only wish was to[BR]
have our train up and running...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And you made it come true![WAIT][END]

0F-034
[STYLE:RIGHT]Nyeah heh heh...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Perfect. Mario hates this thing,[BR]
so he'll surely turn back. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Uh... I think...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That doesn't look like the sort[BR]
of thing that'd bother Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder if I should really trust[BR]
what Peach says...[WAIT][END]

0F-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well...it doesn't matter.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]King Bowser ordered it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And he's the boss![WAIT][END]

0F-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]Perfect... Mario really hates[BR]
these guys so he'll run. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Will they really scare him? They[BR]
seem pretty weak...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm getting a little suspicious of[BR]
what Peach tells us... [WAIT][END]

0F-037
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well...it doesn't matter.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]King Bowser ordered it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And he's the boss![WAIT][END]

0F-038
[STYLE:RIGHT]Nyeah heh heh heh!!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Ooh, I can't wait until Mario[BR]
gets here![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's gonna get beaten so bad! [BR]
He'll probably start crying![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Then King Bowser and I will laugh[BR]
and laugh![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Come and get it, Mario![WAIT][END]

0F-039
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Wavy}Nyeah heh heh hah!!!!![WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh... Mario!?[BR]

By myself? Why me?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm toast...but I have to try![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Feel my, uh...wrath, I guess![WAIT][END]

[PAUSE:0A]Now I get to defeat you and win[BR]
admiration from King Bowser.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm gonna be famous![WAIT][END]

0F-040
[STYLE:RIGHT]Everybody calls me Gourmet Guy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't know why. I'm just an[BR]
ordinary, food-loving Shy Guy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sigh...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm hungry...[WAIT][END]

0F-041
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm too hungry to move.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm famished! I must eat![BR]
