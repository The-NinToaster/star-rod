And you must be Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I've heard a lot about you, son.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You're trying your best to save[BR]
the Star Spirits and the rest of[BR]
your world, aren't you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Very noble. If that is true, then[BR]
your arrival means a Star Spirit[BR]
is here in our land.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I would help you in your quest,[BR]
but alas...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I cannot right now.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Flower Fields is in trouble.[WAIT][END]

11-003
[STYLE:RIGHT]A creature named Huff N. Puff[BR]
and his followers invaded our[BR]
fair land not long ago.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These creatures brought clouds[BR]
to our sunny sky. It has been[BR]
dark and cloudy ever since.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The sun doesn't even bother to[BR]
rise in the sky anymore.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We are all weak and fading...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:05]Oh! I remember something![BR]
[PAUSE:03]The rumor is that Huff N. Puff[BR]
is holding somebody captive...[BR]
[PAUSE:05][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:05]Of course![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It must be the Star Spirit that[BR]
you're searching for![WAIT][END]

11-004
[STYLE:RIGHT]...Oh ho?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]You're going to defeat the[BR]
wicked Huff N. Puff, then?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, that would make the wishes[BR]
of Flower Fields come true...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But it's not that easy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Huff N. Puff is up in the sky, on[BR]
what we call the Cloudy Climb.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]There's no way up there now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, [BR]
[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03]You might be able to reach it[BR]
if you find a Magical Bean or[BR]
something that grows high...[WAIT][END]

11-005
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now, wait a minute...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think there IS a flower that[BR]
has a Magical Bean...somewhere.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Umm... [PAUSE:07]I believe...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Her name is Petunia.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Perhaps she is off to the east.[BR]
It wouldn't hurt to go visit her[BR]
and ask about it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The other flowers and Bub-ulbs[BR]
around here might have some[BR]
useful information, as well.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'd say talk to everyone![WAIT][END]

11-006
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, thank you, Mario. You did a[BR]
tree-mendous job.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You cleared off those clouds so[BR]
the sun could rise once more.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's so nice seeing my dear[BR]
Flower Fields full of light again[BR]
after such a long time.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's nothing like sunlight![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh yes, of course![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You should plant that Magical[BR]
Bean, don't you think?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It should grow well now. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'd say the best place for you[BR]
to plant it would be over there[BR]
where you can see the soil.[WAIT][END]

11-007
[NEXT]
If you want to plant the bean,[BR]
the best place is that patch[BR]
where you can see the soil.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hurry up and plant it![WAIT][END]

11-008
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ho now! What are you doing?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Haven't you ever grown a plant?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you're planting something,[BR]
the order is soil, then the bean,[BR]
then water.[WAIT][END]

Then water!!![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...That's the only way![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Come on, now. You can do it![WAIT][END]

11-00A

You saved the Star Spirit![BR]

11-00E
[NEXT]
If a bean is what you seek, you[BR]
ought to ask Petunia if she'll[BR]
give one to you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Petunia's hobby is collecting[BR]
rare beans and seeds.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She has this and that and then[BR]
some other things...and she likely[BR]
has a Magical Bean.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That particular bean definitely[BR]
is the best one...[WAIT][END]

Have you met Posie, by chance?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]She's a wonderful flower.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The soil is very nutritious and[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
As a result, Posie's flowers[BR]
always grow and grow...[WAIT][END]

The spring water that flows[BR]
where Lily the Flower Spirit[BR]
grows is so refreshing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Is that spring still gushing?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wonder how Lily's doing...[WAIT][END]

11-011
[NEXT]
The lack of sunshine completely[BR]
robs us of our vigor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If these clouds continue, we'll[BR]
all likely wither up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If only I could move around...[BR]
I'd take a journey to the Sun[BR]
Tower to cheer the sun up.[WAIT][END]

11-012
[NEXT]
Oh, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Huff N. Puff is on Cloudy Climb.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can reach Cloudy Climb by[BR]
riding on the leaf of the Bean[BR]

Thanks to you, everyone in[BR]
Flower Fields can live in peace.[WAIT][END]

11-016
[STYLE:RIGHT]You want to meet Petunia?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That flower seems a little[BR]
strange to me, you know.[BR]

She collects beans and seeds,[BR]
but she never grows them.[BR]

She just likes seeds.[BR]

They're both beautiful![BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Every flower is beautiful.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Petunia?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The Seed Maniac, Petunia? The[BR]
one who collects seeds like a[BR]
crazy flower?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I know her. She's growing due[BR]
east from here.[WAIT][END]

11-01E
[STYLE:RIGHT]There are so many beautiful[BR]
flowers in Flower Fields.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It would be a mistake to judge[BR]
them by their beauty, though.[BR]
Not all of them are gentle[BR]
flowers, that's for sure.[WAIT][END]

11-01F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Lily is very beautiful, but I've[BR]
heard that she's more than a[BR]
little bit strange.[BR]

They say she always floats in[BR]
the water, dreaming of things[BR]
that could never happen.[WAIT][END]

many clouds are in the way.[BR]

I wonder how it would feel to be[BR]
the center of attention all the[BR]
time... [WAIT][END]

11-024
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm sick of this weather. Flower[BR]
Fields is always cloudy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It never used to be like this.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That Huff N. Puff's the cause![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Plants like us can't live long[BR]
without the light of the sun.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Everybody around here is losing[BR]
hope and starting to wither...[WAIT][END]

11-025
[STYLE:RIGHT]Every plant needs good soil in[BR]
order to grow big and healthy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The more nutritious the soil is,[BR]
the bigger plants can grow.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And then, plants that grow[BR]
really big give nutrition back![BR]
They drop their leaves, and the[BR]
leaves become fertilizer.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We grew with the nutrition of[BR]
Wise Wisterwood's fallen leaves.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So Wise Wisterwood is kind of[BR]
like our father, huh?[WAIT][END]

11-026
[STYLE:RIGHT]Have you seen the Crystal Tree[BR]
near Posie's place yet?[BR]

If you believe what folks say,[BR]
those berries are the most[BR]
beautiful things in the world.[WAIT][END]

11-027

We can't live in Flower Fields[BR]

11-02B
[STYLE:RIGHT]The sun can't come up because[BR]
a thick cloud is completely[BR]
covering the sky.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We Bub-ulbs can live just about[BR]
anywhere if there's sun, but now[BR]
there's none at all![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm not saying that having some[BR]
clouds is bad. Of course not![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But there should be some gaps[BR]
for a little precious sunshine![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sigh... I hate that stupid cloud.[WAIT][END]

11-02C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Without sunlight, the seeds we[BR]
have can't sprout, and we can't[BR]
make any new ones, either.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If the sun never rises again, all[BR]
of Flower Fields will wither up[BR]
completely.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you have any ideas?[WAIT][END]

11-02D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Are you looking for water?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You might try Lily's spring.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But if you want water to plant[BR]
something, it's hopeless. [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's no use planting now. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even if you water them, plants[BR]
won't grow without the sun.[WAIT][END]

11-02E
[STYLE:RIGHT]You mean you're thinking of[BR]
doing something to that thick[BR]
cloud so the sun can rise again?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You think that'll work?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, it would be so nice if the sun[BR]
rose up again![BR]

I hope your plan works...[WAIT][END]

I can't stand that Huff N. Puff.[BR]

Why? Because Spike is a million[BR]
