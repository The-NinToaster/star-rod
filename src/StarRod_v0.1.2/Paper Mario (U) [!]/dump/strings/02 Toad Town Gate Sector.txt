the language of the Shy Guys.[BR]

Let's see here...yes...accents...[BR]
...mmm...silent "d", hmmm...[BR]

I'll tell you what: I'll take[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Now what could this be about...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Hm! How exceedingly strange.[BR]
It's from Lavalava Island.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...Yes, yes.  It's a question[BR]
from a curious kid there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My mind is quite in demand.[BR]
Thank you, Parakarry. I thank[BR]
you for your quick delivery.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't usually accept[BR]
questions, but oh, well...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's from a kid, and we must[BR]
educate the younger generation.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]When I was a child, I had a[BR]
curious mind as well. Still do![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll get right on the answer.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Thanks again for bringing this[BR]

[PAUSE:05]Please take this as thanks.[WAIT][END]

02-015
[STYLE:RIGHT]Above us, on the top floor,[BR]
there is a Dojo.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We are here! Always![BR]
Training at the Dojo![BR]

Unless our Master isn't here,[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
A letter just arrived saying[BR]
The Master will return soon.[BR]
We will train again soon![WAIT][END]

02-016
[STYLE:RIGHT]Our Master is wandering [BR]
the world to purify his mind[BR]
and train his body.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Our Master was a strong man.[BR]
He is going to come back[BR]
a very, very strong man.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We will wait here, right here,[BR]

wheeze...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Please pardon me.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]My health is rather delicate...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Every day we train in this Dojo[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]When fighting, you must try[BR]
many tactics. A good fighter[BR]
does not use the same simple[BR]
attack each time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Each enemy has its own [BR]
character and weak points.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sometimes you use your body...[BR]
Sometimes you use your items...[BR]
but always, ALWAYS you must [BR]
use your mind.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sometimes you will be surprised[BR]
by what's effective.[WAIT][END]

02-01C
[STYLE:RIGHT]A wise fighter knows that[BR]
sometimes the best tactic is[BR]
not to fight at all.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There is no cowardice in[BR]
choosing to run away from a[BR]
superior foe.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, you will find some [BR]
enemies that are impossible to[BR]
escape, once in battle.[BR]
Face them with bravery.[WAIT][END]

02-01D
[NEXT]
Very well.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Then Chan will fight you.[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Very well.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I give you this, Mario.[WAIT][END]

02-024

Very well.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]This time, Lee will fight you.[BR]

02-02C
[NEXT]
Very well!  Mario...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]I will fight you again.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I will not go easy on you[BR]
this time, however.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You must concentrate fully if[BR]
you hope to compete.[WAIT][END]

02-02D
[NEXT]
Very well![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I will fight you once more.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This time, I will hold nothing[BR]
back at all.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Do you believe you're ready?[WAIT][END]

02-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]Don't lose your concentration.[BR]

Mario. You are truly a [BR]

You'd think that'd be relaxing.[BR]
But this house isn't exactly[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
My wife doesn't even have any[BR]
spare time to spend with me.[BR]
