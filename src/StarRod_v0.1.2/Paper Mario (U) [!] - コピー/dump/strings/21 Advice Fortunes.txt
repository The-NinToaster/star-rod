[STYLE:RIGHT]You must journey to Koopa Bros.[BR]
Fortress. You can travel there[BR]
by following Pleasant Path to[BR]
the east of town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The path begins right next to[BR]
Toad's house.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you have any problems getting[BR]
started, please don't hesitate[BR]
to ask for my help.[WAIT][END]

21-001
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you stuck on the way[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]You smash this tree.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Something drops to aid you.[WAIT][END]

21-002
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see Koopas in trouble.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]These must be the Koopas in[BR]
Koopa Village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You are kind, and you help them[BR]
with their troubles.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
One of the Koopas you help tells[BR]
you the location of the house[BR]
where the Koopa with the blue[BR]
shell lives.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Only that blue-shelled Koopa[BR]
can help you overcome the[BR]
difficulties that lie in wait on[BR]
the road ahead.[WAIT][END]

21-003
[STYLE:RIGHT]The four Koopa brothers are[BR]
holding a Star Spirit hostage.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They lurk in the stone fortress[BR]
at the end of Pleasant Path,[BR]
to the east of Toad Town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It is a long journey east, even[BR]
from Koopa Village, and the road[BR]
is full of enemies.[WAIT][END]

21-004
[STYLE:RIGHT]The stone fortress is locked,[BR]
and it's guarded by Koopas.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You wander its depths, hunting[BR]
for a key.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A pink tomboy with an explosive[BR]
personality is locked in the[BR]
basement jail there.[BR]

You help her escape.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]She ends up helping you, too.[WAIT][END]

21-005
[STYLE:RIGHT]The noble Star Spirit is[BR]
imprisoned on the top floor of[BR]
the stone fortress. [BR]

Your blue-shelled Koopa and[BR]
explosive Bob-omb are the keys[BR]
to cutting the Koopa brothers[BR]
down to size.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You move with haste now.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The Star Spirit has many[BR]
important things to tell you.[WAIT][END]

21-006
[STYLE:RIGHT]You go to the south of Toad Town[BR]
and find a station that is the[BR]
departure point to a far-off[BR]
land.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The red train at the station[BR]
cannot leave.  [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Somehow, you destroy the[BR]
obstacle blocking the track.[WAIT][END]

21-007
[STYLE:RIGHT]You reach a mountain by train[BR]
but the crevasses there are[BR]
too difficult to cross.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A winged Koopa is fussing about,[BR]
waiting for help on the steep,[BR]
stony mountainside.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You help him out[BR]
[PAUSE:05]and earn some help yourself.[WAIT][END]

21-008
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you climbing over a[BR]
mountain in search of a desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Braving great dangers, you[BR]
cross the mountain and descend[BR]
to the mouth of an ocean of[BR]
sand.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Your true goal lies hidden within.[WAIT][END]

21-009
[STYLE:RIGHT]At the end of the path in the[BR]
desert, there is a dusty town[BR]
where travelers rest.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It is there where you will find[BR]
some answers you seek.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you leave the desert path,[BR]
you are quickly swallowed up by[BR]
the trackless desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
For now, you stick to the path[BR]
and end up in the town.[WAIT][END]

21-00A
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you handing something[BR]
to a strange Nomadimouse that[BR]
resides in a desert town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Nomadimouse waits in the[BR]
back of the desert town,[BR]
hiding its face with a cloth.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To find that which you seek,[BR]
you give up something you have[BR]
already found.[WAIT][END]

21-00B
[STYLE:RIGHT]The strange Nomadimouse I spoke[BR]
of...he does not tell you what[BR]
you want to know, even though[BR]
you've given him gifts?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, perhaps you have not given[BR]
him what he desires.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You go south as soon as you[BR]
leave the desert town and soon[BR]
you find a lush oasis.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A fruit ripening on the tree is[BR]
what you seek. You find it and[BR]
give it to the Nomadimouse.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
For this treat, he breaks his[BR]
code of silence and gives you[BR]
the clue you need.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Beyond this, I can see nothing.[WAIT][END]

21-00C
[STYLE:RIGHT]The one who knows the mystery[BR]
of the desert hides on top of[BR]
an old building.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A strange Nomadimouse at the[BR]
far end of town once waited by[BR]
a door. You check this door.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]From there, you climb upward.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
On the rooftops, you meet the[BR]
mysterious leader of the desert.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]You find him over to the left[BR]
from where you climb up.[WAIT][END]

21-00D
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you putting a bright,[BR]
flashing stone on a small rock[BR]
after wandering around the[BR]
desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmm...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Mmmmmmmmm...![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I cannot see exactly where it is,[BR]
but the flashing stone is pulsing[BR]
rapidly and there is just one[BR]
rock in the area.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Wait...something else...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It is on the opposite side of the[BR]
desert from the oasis.[WAIT][END]

21-00E
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you entering the ruins[BR]
that used to be buried deep in[BR]
the desert sand.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are many surprises inside[BR]
the old buildings.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
First you find a way to [BR]
strengthen yourself, [PAUSE:0A]and then[BR]
you find three precious stones.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Deep inside, you set the stones[BR]
in the correct places on statues.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is the correct way:[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
the Pyramid on the left,[BR]
the Diamond in the middle and[BR]
the Lunar on the right.[WAIT][END]

21-00F
[STYLE:RIGHT]You go down the new stairs that[BR]
appear in the deepest depths of[BR]
the ruins.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You descend further, drawn by[BR]
the imprisoned Star Spirit[BR]
imprisoned below you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A Koopa wrecks the ruins,[BR]
trying to destroy you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You fight off this magic-wielding[BR]
menace and save the Star Spirit.[WAIT][END]

21-010
[STYLE:RIGHT]Deep inside a strange forest,[BR]
someone waits in the darkness[BR]
for you to arrive.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He floats through the air,[BR]
appearing and disappearing.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He shows you the way.[WAIT][END]

21-011
[STYLE:RIGHT]In the dangerous gloom of[BR]
Forever Forest, [PAUSE:05]I can see you[BR]
talking with a creature who lives[BR]
there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You turn your back to the moving[BR]
bush and go into the depths of[BR]
the forest.[BR]
You find him waiting.[WAIT][END]

21-012
[STYLE:RIGHT]In the shadowy Forever Forest,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]you must take the right path to[BR]
get out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
One path always looks different[BR]
from the others, [PAUSE:05]and that path[BR]
is the one you always take.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You look carefully at the [BR]
scenery to find your way. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A wise member of your party[BR]
may well give you an important[BR]
hint.[WAIT][END]

21-013
[STYLE:RIGHT]When you escape Forever Forest,[BR]
you find a spooky mansion hidden[BR]
in the trees.[BR]

mansion.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Inside, you gather some[BR]
important information.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You enter without fear.[WAIT][END]

21-014
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you wandering in Boo's[BR]
mansion, trying to find the way [BR]
to get upstairs.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
At every turn, Boos play tricks[BR]
and set puzzles. You wisely[BR]
solve them all.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now...I can see you standing [BR]
with a record in your hand in[BR]
front of a phonograph.[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]You climb onto the sofa on the[BR]
first floor of Boo's mansion.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You launch into the air and[BR]
pull down the chandelier, which[BR]
moves a glass case.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In order to enter the door[BR]
hidden by the glass case, [BR]
you hang a heavy weight from[BR]
the chandelier.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Somewhere beyond the door, [BR]
a powerful item awaits.[WAIT][END]

21-016
[STYLE:RIGHT]In Boo's Mansion in Forever[BR]
Forest, I can see a staircase[BR]
leading downstairs.[BR]

In a back room, you challenge[BR]
Boos for a new pair of Boots.[BR]

You Spin Jump on the boarded[BR]
floor and break through, finding[BR]
a new path.[WAIT][END]

upstairs, you find a pair of[BR]
Boos waiting for you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They tell you many things.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You realize that not all Boos are[BR]
troublemakers.[WAIT][END]

21-018
[STYLE:RIGHT]There's only one thing that has[BR]
the power to scare Boos.[BR]
I speak of a castle-dwelling[BR]
monster that can never be hurt.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are many stories about[BR]
this immortal creature.[BR]
The Boos living on the windy hill[BR]
have heard them all.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You listen carefully to these[BR]
tales then bravely head for[BR]
the castle on the hill.[WAIT][END]

21-019
[STYLE:RIGHT]Although you enter the castle[BR]
on the windy hill, you are[BR]
stopped by a locked door.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You begin your search for the [BR]
door key.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In a room containing a large[BR]
table, you open a small door and[BR]
see stairs going down.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Once you descend, you notice a[BR]
boarded piece of floor that you[BR]
can break. [BR]

Down in the basement, you find[BR]
the key that you seek.[WAIT][END]

21-01A
[STYLE:RIGHT]In the castle on the windy hill,[BR]

You unlock the door and step[BR]
into the heart of the mystery.[WAIT][END]

21-01C
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you running away as[BR]
fast as you can.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You open the treasure chest[BR]
next to the bed where the[BR]
immortal monster is taking an[BR]
afternoon nap.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You find a magic talking key[BR]
inside the chest.[BR]

citizens of Toad Town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You walk west from the southern[BR]
shop and see these small people[BR]
entering and leaving the second[BR]
house from the shop.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They don't enter the house if[BR]
they see someone inside because[BR]
they're cowards.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You turn invisible to trick them.[WAIT][END]

21-01F
[STYLE:RIGHT]You go into the house second[BR]
from the shop in the south of[BR]
Toad Town,[BR]

leads to a Toy Box.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The mischievous thieves and all[BR]
of their stolen goods are inside[BR]
the box. You leap in after them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Inside the Toy Box, you use[BR]
jack-in-the-boxes to move on.[BR]

The jack-in-the-boxes with[BR]
stars on their sides make you[BR]

You find a key and return to[BR]
Toad Town.[WAIT][END]

take something that you noticed[BR]
was missing inside the Toy Box.  [WAIT][END]

21-021

but you cannot jump to your[BR]
goal.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You jump to a high spot near[BR]
the platform and hitch a ride[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
An illegible memo is the key to[BR]
continuing through the Toy Box.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You give the dictionary back[BR]

stands guard over.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You give the yellow flower a[BR]
Yellow Berry, and it repays you[BR]
by opening the gate.[BR]

By smashing the tree beyond the[BR]
red flower's gate, you find the[BR]
Yellow Berry you need.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]The precious stone that the[BR]
flower of the spring seeks is[BR]
in the garden beyond a confusing[BR]
hedge maze.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The keeper of this garden has[BR]
many thorns but is very[BR]
beautiful. You hang on every[BR]
word she says. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A sparkling berry from a crystal[BR]
tree is the only treasure[BR]
beautiful enough to match the[BR]
Water Stone.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You talk to Posie and she gives[BR]
you what you need.[WAIT][END]

21-039

When you put the stone in the[BR]
dry spring, water begins to flow[BR]
like magic.[WAIT][END]

21-03A
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see you trying to clear[BR]
the air of clouds. You search[BR]
in vain for the sun, hurrying[BR]
beneath dark clouds.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The sun, trapped by the[BR]
menacing sky, cannot rise.[BR]
He tells you important news.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A cloud rider stops you as you[BR]
travel from your visit with the[BR]
sun. He will join you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
With his aid, you stomp on the[BR]
colored blocks in the correct[BR]
order: green, purple, red,[BR]
green, green, purple.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you find the cloud-making[BR]
machine, you smash it to bits[BR]
and bring the bright sky back.[WAIT][END]

Next, you plant the seed.[BR]
Finally, you give it water.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Only the right order will do.[BR]

Using your new ability, you are[BR]
able to enter a new path.[BR]
A blue door on a high ledge[BR]
beckons, but you can't reach it.[BR]

There are several things[BR]
invisible to the naked eye near[BR]
the door.[BR]

the most powerful penguin[BR]
in the city.[WAIT][END]

21-041
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see some snowmen in a row[BR]
in front of a cliff.[BR]

The way to the frozen heights[BR]
opens soon after.[WAIT][END]

21-042
[STYLE:RIGHT]You climb up a steep mountain[BR]
and break the cracked wall[BR]
beyond the stairs. You enter an[BR]
icy cave.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The room is filled with crystal[BR]
pillars, and your eyes deceive[BR]
you. You think for a moment that[BR]
it's a dead end.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You don't trust your eyes.[BR]
You keep moving forward.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You find something helpful once[BR]
you break the illusion.[WAIT][END]

21-043
[STYLE:RIGHT]Someone needs your help in the[BR]
Crystal Palace that perches[BR]
atop the mountain. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You have received a gift.[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Once you've scaled the frozen[BR]
heights you spot the palace[BR]
you need to reach.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]In the Crystal Palace, often[BR]
what you do on one side of the[BR]
glass affects what happens on [BR]
the other side.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You break a boarded piece of[BR]
floor in the back, then go back[BR]
to a room in the front.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Where there once was a red X,[BR]
there is now a hole.[WAIT][END]

21-046
[STYLE:RIGHT]You enter the red door and[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
You place your explosive friend[BR]
by a red switch and go through[BR]
a revolving door.[BR]

Your Koopa friend helps you hit[BR]
a switch in the reflection.[BR]

your way around to its twin.[BR]

statue has moved as well.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]I see creatures that change[BR]
direction when you talk to them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I also see identical stone[BR]
statues that you can move by[BR]
pushing them from the rear.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
By talking to the creatures,[BR]
you get them to face the right[BR]
directions. You then push them[BR]
to cover the pads on the floor.[BR]

Once you solve the puzzle,[BR]
stairs appear that lead to[BR]
the door high up on the wall.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You continue into the palace.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]A frozen king rules in the[BR]
palace on the snowy mountain.[BR]

kings, but two of them are[BR]
phantoms. To be sure, you[BR]
attack all of them at once.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The last Star Spirit is freed[BR]
once you defeat him.[WAIT][END]

21-049
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can see the Star Spirits[BR]
gathering and waiting on[BR]
Shooting Star Summit.[BR]

continue your journey to the top[BR]

A repeating series of high and[BR]
low paths confuses you.[BR]

fence give you a clue. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You go forward in the same[BR]
order as the torches: up, down,[BR]
down, up, down, up.[BR]
