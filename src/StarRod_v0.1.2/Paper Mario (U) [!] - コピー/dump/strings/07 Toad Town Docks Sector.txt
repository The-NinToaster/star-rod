important research![WAIT][END]

07-08B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario...old chum...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I must have that artifact![BR]
I can't stop thinking of it![WAIT][END]

07-08C
[STYLE:RIGHT][NEXT]
Oh dear...[BR]
[PAUSE:14]Won't you change your mind?[WAIT][END]

07-08D
[STYLE:RIGHT][NEXT]
Oh, bother![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I suppose nothing I can say will[BR]
sway you. How tragic.[BR]
How very sad.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess I'll just suffer...[WAIT][END]

07-08E
[STYLE:RIGHT][NEXT]
Cheers, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Smashing, really, old boy![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Soon now, the mystery of[BR]
Dry Dry Ruins will rise from[BR]
the sands that conceal it![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As a brilliant archaeologist,[BR]
I say it must be so![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmm, yes, of course, well. I[BR]
suppose a thank-you gift is in[BR]
order, eh, old boy?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Here you go then![WAIT][END]

07-08F
[STYLE:RIGHT]I found it in Dry Dry Desert.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I have no use for it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now then! Let's get down to[BR]
brass tacks, eh? Let's solve[BR]
this mystery in front of us![WAIT][END]

07-090
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ouch! Yeeowch![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What are you doing![WAIT][END]

07-091
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, good heavens![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was wondering what this was.[BR]
It seems to be a huge tuna![WAIT][END]

07-092
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Wavy}Ooooog...[BR]
{EndFX:Wavy}I'm not a tuna. I'm a whale.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...And I have problems![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It feels like something's jumping[BR]
around in my belly![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ow ow ow... Help me![WAIT][END]

07-093
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hmm... I say...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Old boy, this great tuna seems[BR]
to have a bit of a bellyache.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, what say you lend the fish[BR]
a hand, hm?[WAIT][END]

07-094
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ugh...[BR]
I told you I'm not a tuna...[BR]
I'm not even a fish...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And I have a headache from your[BR]
jumping around on me, too! Do[BR]
you think you could check my[BR]
belly?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm begging you, please...[WAIT][END]

07-095
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now, now, [PAUSE:0A]you really should help[BR]
out, dear boy.[WAIT][END]

07-096
[STYLE:RIGHT]Me...? In there? Poppycock![BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]My grandmother's last words,[BR]
and I quote, were: "Do not go[BR]
inside a giant tuna."[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wouldn't hesitate, of course,[BR]
being a fearless explorer,[BR]
but dear boy, one simply can't[BR]
ignore one's grandmother.[WAIT][END]

07-097
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...something bouncing around in[BR]
my stomach...I feel queasy...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Please help me....[WAIT][END]

07-098
[STYLE:RIGHT]Did you see what's going on in my[BR]
stomach? What is it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do something--fast![WAIT][END]

07-099
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Aw! My tongue![BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}[PAUSE:0A]What are you doing!?[WAIT][END]

07-09A
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Ouch! That hurt![BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}[PAUSE:0A]What are you doing!?[WAIT][END]

07-09B
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Jitter}Waaaah![BR]
Who dat!![BR]
{EndFX:Jitter}[WAIT][NEXT]
What d'you think you're doin'[BR]
with that light?[WAIT][END]

07-09C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, fella![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You wanna piece o' this?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{StartFX:Shrinking}You got it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm ornery as all get out![BR]
Prepare for some pain![WAIT][END]

07-09D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Awwwww...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Shucks![BR]
[PAUSE:05]First I think I get away from[BR]
that ol' fishin' man...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
and then I get all swallowed up[BR]
by some huge fish...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]and then this fella with the[BR]
mustache goes upside my head.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've just been fallin' outta[BR]
fryin' pans into fires since[BR]
I was just a grub. Talk about[BR]
a lousy lot in life.[WAIT][END]

07-09E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, it's me![BR]
[PAUSE:05]You know, the whale?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Can you hear me?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That stomachache seems to have[BR]
cleared right up![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I feel fantastic![WAIT][END]

07-09F
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Whooooosh![BR]
[PAUSE:0F][END]

07-0A0
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, it's you, boy![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You're that dumb ol' fish that[BR]
ate me all up and such![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You plumb idiot![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You know, I thought I was a[BR]
goner for sure![WAIT][END]

07-0A1
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm awfully sorry.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was just having a nap with my[BR]
mouth open.[WAIT][END]

07-0A2
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I suppose I can see my way to[BR]
forgivin' you this time, but[BR]
you just watch it.[BR]
[WAIT]{Func_04}[NEXT]
Er... [PAUSE:0A]I reckon I owe you some[BR]
thanks, after all, Mr. Mustache.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Y'all take care, now.[WAIT][END]

07-0A3
[STYLE:RIGHT]Whew![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I feel so much better now![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They should call you Dr. Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There must be some way I can[BR]
express my gratitude![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've got it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I, the tuna, am... [PAUSE:0A]I mean...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I, the whale, am quite good at[BR]
swimming.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To express my thanks, I'll take[BR]
you anywhere you want to go.[WAIT][END]

07-0A4
[STYLE:RIGHT]Pardon the eavesdropping, but[BR]
did you just say "anywhere"?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario! You old tuna tamer![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Accompany me to the shores of[BR]
Lavalava Island![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What a trip it'll be![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The island will be wonderful![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You must trust my instincts![WAIT][END]

07-0A5
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]didn't Twink say one of the Star[BR]
Spirits was on Lavalava Island?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is just what we needed.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's hop on this whale and go![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But this Kolorado character...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He'll probably be really[BR]
disappointed if we don't take[BR]
him along with us. I think the[BR]
whale can carry us all.[WAIT][END]

07-0A6
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think Twink said one of the[BR]
Star Spirits was being held on[BR]
Lavalava Island.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is quite timely.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We'd better get on the whale.[WAIT][END]

07-0A7
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well now, Mario,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
wasn't Lavalava Island the[BR]
place where one of the Star[BR]
Spirits was being held?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You remember what Twink said,[BR]
don't you? I do, anyway.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is our chance.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's get on the whale.[WAIT][END]

07-0A8
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I just remembered what Twink[BR]
said. He said one of the Star[BR]
Spirits was being held on[BR]
Lavalava Island...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This could be our chance.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We'll get there on this whale.[WAIT][END]

07-0A9
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I believe Twink said one of the[BR]
Star Spirits was being held on[BR]
Lavalava Island.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Perfect timing.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's ride the whale.[WAIT][END]

07-0AA
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, um...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think the Star Kid said a Star[BR]
Spirit was...um, caught on the[BR]
big Lavalava Island.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We...um, we should go.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Big whale give us a ride. Whee![WAIT][END]

07-0AB
[STYLE:RIGHT]Huh? [PAUSE:05]Lavalava Island?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Yes, of course I know where it[BR]
is, but...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's a big volcano on the[BR]
island and it's on the verge of[BR]
erupting. Very dangerous.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Do you still want to go?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well... [PAUSE:0A]OK, then. It's your call.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Just let me know when you're[BR]
ready to go.[WAIT][END]

07-0AC
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, old boy, you must[BR]
remember to take me to Lava-[BR]
lava Island with you![WAIT][END]

07-0AD
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ulp. Sure this is safe, then?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Make some room, hm?[WAIT][END]

07-0AE
[STYLE:RIGHT]OK![BR]
[PAUSE:0F]We're off to Lavalava Island![BR]
The sea is calling![WAIT][END]

07-0AF
[STYLE:RIGHT]I can't believe we're on a tuna.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]do you ever think about how[BR]
strange life can be? I do.[BR]
[PAUSE:1E][END]

07-0B0
[STYLE:RIGHT]Do you want to go to[BR]
Lavalava Island?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

07-0B1
[STYLE:RIGHT]Let's go![WAIT][END]

07-0B2
[NEXT]
Just come speak to me when you[BR]
want to go, OK?[WAIT][END]

07-0B3
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thank heavens we've arrived![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Now, tuna-ferrying is one[BR]
experience I shan't do again.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Cheers for the ride, though![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm in your debt.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
For now, I'm heading back to[BR]
Koopa Village to relax.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]My wife must be waiting for me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Perhaps our paths will cross[BR]
again in the future, old boy![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Cheerio![WAIT][END]

07-0B4
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}{StartFX:Jitter}Woooooooooooooooooooh!![WAIT][END]

07-0B5
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Wavy}Wheeze wheeze wheeze...[BR]
{EndFX:Wavy}[WAIT][NEXT]
I...will never...swim again...[BR]
for the rest...of...my life![WAIT][END]

07-0B6
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You're mine this time![WAIT][END]

07-0B7
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}{StartFX:Jitter}Ayaaaaaaaaah![BR]
[PAUSE:0A][END]

07-0B8
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Wavy}Wheeze wheeze wheeze...[BR]
{EndFX:Wavy}[WAIT][NEXT]
Here it comes![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You... [PAUSE:05]you'd better be ready![WAIT][END]

07-0B9
[STYLE:RIGHT]Gasp! [PAUSE:05]Oh, no!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]All that swimming! My HP is[BR]
almost gone![WAIT][END]

07-0BA
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well, I'll make up for my low HP[BR]
by using my new skills![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Check this out![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]{Size:20:20}More power!![WAIT][END]

07-0BB
[STYLE:RIGHT]I know all of your fighting[BR]
patterns now, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
See my gear?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]The spike, the wings... You[BR]
can't attack me now![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm the smartest fighter alive![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't be defeated! Wa ha ha![WAIT][END]

07-0BC
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yow! What in the...?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I didn't think you'd do that![BR]
Is that even legal?[WAIT][END]

07-0BD
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Wavy}Aaaaaaaaaaaugh---[WAIT][END]

07-0BE
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, you know what?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Now that I think about it...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have wings... If I had just[BR]
flown to the island, I wouldn't[BR]
have wasted my HP.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Then I probably would have[BR]
beaten Mario in no time![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Sigh.........[WAIT][END]

07-0BF
[STYLE:RIGHT]Aargh![BR]
No more time![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Too bad!![BR]
Please try again next time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
See you at the next trading[BR]
event, all right?[BR]
So long![WAIT][END]

I'm the Toad from the trading[BR]
event. How are you?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Did you bring the item?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
No?[BR]
[PAUSE:14]You don't have anything?[BR]

07-0C4
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wrong! Sorry.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]That's not the right item.[BR]

As a penalty, I'm afraid I'll[BR]
have to take this item away.[WAIT][END]

07-0C5
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hello?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]You don't want the item?[WAIT][END]
