[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the west entrance to[BR]
Toad Town. In case you couldn't[BR]
tell, it's the main gate.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The fancy gate and the star[BR]
emblem on the ground are symbols[BR]
of this fair town.  [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Goomba Village, where my house[BR]
is, is a brief journey west from[BR]
here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'll find a very smart Toad[BR]
named Russ T. living in this town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He knows lots of useful[BR]
information for adventurers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'll also find shops that sell[BR]
various items.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh yeah! There's also a Dojo.[WAIT][END]

19-001
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the central area of Toad[BR]
Town, a plaza in front of[BR]
Princess Peach's Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Pleasant Path begins to the[BR]
east of here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This used to be a bustling area[BR]
before Bowser's attack. Guests[BR]
at the castle were always in[BR]
and out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And tourists came from all over[BR]
to see the castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The wizard Merlon also lives[BR]
around here. If you get stuck,[BR]
his fortune-telling might just[BR]
help you out![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's also a Toad House where[BR]
you can take a short rest and[BR]
a post office where you can pick[BR]
up mail for your party members.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Also, over by the flower garden,[BR]
there's a guy named Rowf who's[BR]
opening his own specialty shop.[WAIT][END]

19-002
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Miss. Tayce T., a famous local[BR]
cook, lives around here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm pretty sure my mom wants to[BR]
learn cooking from her.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Tayce T. will cook for you if you[BR]
take ingredients to her.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh yeah! Forever Forest lies to[BR]
the east,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
so a Toad watchman stands guard[BR]
there and prevents people from[BR]
wandering in.[WAIT][END]

19-003
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's Toad Town Station.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a station for the Dry Dry[BR]
Railroad. From there, you can[BR]
take the train to scenic[BR]
Mt. Rugged.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And there's also Oink-Oink Farm,[BR]
where they raise Li'l-Oinks.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Raising Li'l-Oinks costs coins.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My dad said there's a Playroom [BR]
here, but I don't see it...[WAIT][END]

19-004
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the residential area of[BR]
Toad Town. It's mostly homes.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But there's also a shop.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
For Toad Town, this area is[BR]
pretty quiet.[WAIT][END]

19-005
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Toad Town's port. It's[BR]
home to the only restaurant in[BR]
town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I like to stand at the end of[BR]
the pier and gaze at the sea.[WAIT][END]

19-006
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the reception area for[BR]
the Playroom.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You should ask what kind of[BR]
games they have, Mario.[WAIT][END]

19-007
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's called Jump Attack.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If you win the game, you'll collect[BR]
lots of coins.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you lose, you won't get a[BR]
thing. Too bad![WAIT][END]

19-008
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}They said this is called Smash[BR]
Attack.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The idea is to whack the blocks[BR]
placed on the floor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's get in there and smash all[BR]
of 'em! [PAUSE:05]But...[BR]
Actually, it may not be a good[BR]
idea to hit them all.[WAIT][END]

19-009
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Peach's Castle[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03]. [BR]
[PAUSE:03]used to be here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's not even a trace of it[BR]
now. How awful![WAIT][END]

19-00A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Peach's Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But we just came out of[BR]
Bowser's Castle! I've got a[BR]
funny feeling about this...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder where Princess Peach[BR]
is being held captive.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I think we should brace[BR]
ourselves, Mario.[WAIT][END]

19-00B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the first floor hall of[BR]
Princess Peach's Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are so many doors, though.[BR]
Where on earth can Princess[BR]
Peach be?[WAIT][END]

19-00C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the second floor hall of[BR]
Princess Peach's Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are so many doors, though.[BR]
Where on earth can Princess[BR]
Peach be?[WAIT][END]

19-00D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a covered hallway in Peach's[BR]
Castle, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's find Bowser and save[BR]
Princess Peach![WAIT][END]

19-00E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We have to help Princess Peach!![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Mario! [PAUSE:05]Hurry up! Let's move![WAIT][END]

19-00F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow! [PAUSE:08]This is Princess Peach's[BR]
room, isn't it? It smells great[BR]
in here![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's such a cheerful room,[BR]
just like Princess Peach.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't believe she was locked up[BR]
in here for so long, all by[BR]
herself. She must've been so[BR]
lonely[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
We've got to rescue her,[BR]
right now!![WAIT][END]

19-010
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is just an ordinary room.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you smell something, though?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What a strange odor...[WAIT][END]

19-011
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow! So many books.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we weren't in the middle of[BR]
such an adventure, I'd love to[BR]
read some of these.[WAIT][END]

19-012
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This looks like a storeroom.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
.[PAUSE:04].[PAUSE:05].[PAUSE:05]![BR]
Hey! Check out that box! Let's[BR]
see what's in it.[WAIT][END]

19-013
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a dining room.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looks like somebody has eaten[BR]
here recently.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Probably not the princess--[BR]
they're probably starving her![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
People always say that the meals[BR]
served here are delectable.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'd love to eat here sometime.[WAIT][END]

19-014
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a kitchen.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm just guessing, but I bet this[BR]
is where they make the meals.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The castle's head chef probably[BR]
cooks all the meals, don't you[BR]
think?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder what kinds of savory[BR]
dishes he knows how to make.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Hey, Mario...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Have you ever eaten here?[WAIT][END]

19-015
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a pretty huge drawer[BR]
over there.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I bet a person could fit inside![BR]
If they wanted to, that is...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, there's a bed, too![BR]
This must be a guest room.[WAIT][END]

19-016
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, what happened here? This[BR]
is even messier than my room[BR]
back home![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looks like nobody ever puts[BR]
anything away in here.[WAIT][END]

19-017
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Bowser's gone upstairs.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]C'mon, we have to follow him![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Mario, [PAUSE:05]let's roll!![WAIT][END]

19-018
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We have to save the princess!![BR]
Hurry up![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Mario! [PAUSE:05]There's no time to waste![WAIT][END]

19-019
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a castle tower.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]These long spiral stairs go up[BR]
and up and around and around.[BR]
Oog...I feel dizzy.[WAIT][END]

19-01A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Where in the world did Bowser[BR]
just disappear to?[WAIT][END]

19-01B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This balcony has a great view.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm betting that this is one of[BR]
the princess's favorite places.[WAIT][END]

19-01C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This place feels strange and[BR]
mysterious, doesn't it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we go east from here, we'll[BR]
eventually get to Shooting Star[BR]
Summit.[WAIT][END]

19-01D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Shooting Star Summit.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Stars are really...uh, shooting.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
People say that this place,[BR]
like no other, reaches up and[BR]
embraces the sky.[WAIT][END]

19-01E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This must be... Yes! This is the[BR]
legendary Star Way![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a path formed out of actual[BR]
stars.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's absolutely beautiful![WAIT][END]

19-01F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Star Haven.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This place is so peaceful![WAIT][END]

19-020
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This building...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]No, not building... This palace[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]is incredible! Look at this[BR]
architecture, Mario![WAIT][END]

19-021
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Everything seems to be shining[BR]
and glittering in here. I feel[BR]
like I should shield my eyes or[BR]
something.[WAIT][END]

19-022
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the house of an amazingly[BR]
gorgeous woman, the fortune-[BR]
teller Merluvlee.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Merlow, who collects Star Pieces,[BR]
also lives here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This house pulses with psychic[BR]
power. Can you feel it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It feels...weird. It feels like[BR]
I'm floating on some sort of[BR]
spiritual cushion.[WAIT][END]

19-023
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We're in Toad Town Tunnels.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Eew... I wonder what's making[BR]
the water drip from up there?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
At best, I guess this place[BR]
could be called "damp". Although[BR]
"dank" is more like it.[WAIT][END]

19-024
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ugh! I wonder where this filthy[BR]
water is going?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This'd better not drain into the[BR]
sea or the river![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I may have to alert the Goomba [BR]
Environmental Board![WAIT][END]

19-025
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Let's see...disgusting flows[BR]
of water...dripping ceilings...[BR]
Yup, it's gross down here![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Can we leave now?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I... [PAUSE:03]I'm really uncomfortable.[WAIT][END]

19-026
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's a strange platform.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]What do you think'll happen if[BR]
we climb on board?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Are you worried about where the[BR]
platform will end up? That's[BR]
never stopped you before...[WAIT][END]

19-027
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The cool air is certainly nice and[BR]
refreshing,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
but it's too dark, it smells awful[BR]
and I have a bad feeling about[BR]
this place. Let's move![WAIT][END]

19-028
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ah, Toad Town Tunnels![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Visit its scenic filthy streams[BR]
that lead to who-knows-where![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's spectacularly disgusting![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Come stay awhile! If you're not[BR]
totally grossed out the first[BR]
night, you stay for free![WAIT][END]

19-029
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a strange, dark place.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Who'd think that a place like this[BR]
could exist beneath lovely old[BR]
Toad Town?[WAIT][END]

19-02A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Uh... I think this is a sewer.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You know...the Toad Town sewer.[BR]
Under Toad Town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What am I saying? You know![BR]
You're a plumber, after all![WAIT][END]

19-02B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh, gross![BR]
[PAUSE:0F]I've never seen so much sewage[BR]
in my life![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Eew...floating garbage, too![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Talk about disgusting![WAIT][END]

19-02C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I'm sure that some nasty things[BR]
live down here in the dark.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We should be ready to defend[BR]
ourselves in case of a surprise[BR]
attack.[WAIT][END]

19-02D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, I really don't like foul[BR]
water dripping on me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ugh! That one hit the back of my[BR]
neck! Bleah! Where's it dripping[BR]
from?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Can we get out of here or what?[BR]
I hate it here![WAIT][END]

19-02E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Where are we[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Are we lost or what? We've been[BR]
down here so long... You know,[BR]
I didn't know that adventuring[BR]
would be this gross.[WAIT][END]

19-02F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, who could live down here?[BR]
What a crazy dude![WAIT][END]

19-030
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The tunnel is freezing![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I should've worn a sweater![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What do you say we go someplace[BR]
a bit warmer?[WAIT][END]

19-031
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, even though these[BR]
tunnels have many sections[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]you can always count on one[BR]
thing: filthy, stinking water.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Would it be too much to ask to[BR]
get out of here before the[BR]
stench knocks me out?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Seriously! I'm about to wig out![WAIT][END]

19-032
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a room beneath the Toad[BR]
Town pond.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I don't think anyone's been here[BR]
for a long time.[WAIT][END]

19-033
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh, gross! Look, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:05]The water's filthy![BR]
[PAUSE:05]And look! Garbage![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
These tunnels are a total[BR]
nightmare. Let's keep moving [BR]
and get out fast.[WAIT][END]

19-034
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It just keeps getting grosser[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]down here, huh, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-035
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a small room with a single[BR]
pipe in the center.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Don't quote me, but I'm betting[BR]
that the pipe goes somewhere.[WAIT][END]

19-036
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}{StartFX:Wavy}Still Toad Town Tunnels...[BR]
{EndFX:Wavy}[WAIT][NEXT]
We've been in these tunnels so[BR]
long that it's starting to feel[BR]
like... [BR]
[PAUSE:03]I'm [PAUSE:03]becoming [PAUSE:03]a [PAUSE:03]mole[PAUSE:03][HEART] [PAUSE:0A]...ha ha![WAIT][END]

19-037
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It looks like just another[BR]
passage in the tunnels.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I get the feeling...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F][WAIT][NEXT]
that something valuable rests[BR]
around here...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Can't you feel it in your bones?[BR]
Do Goombas have bones?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Anyway, something big is near...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm almost positive.[WAIT][END]

19-038
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}{StartFX:Shrinking}"It smells of treasure here."[BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
{StartFX:Wavy}How was that?[BR]
{EndFX:Wavy}[PAUSE:05]That was my Kolorado imitation.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Any good? Mario? Hello?[WAIT][END]

19-039
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}According to Goombaria,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]this is where you landed.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Something about this clearing[BR]
feels weird. I can't really say[BR]
exactly what, though...[WAIT][END]

19-03A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Goomba Village.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]My family lives here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's also a Toad House, which,[BR]
as you probably know, is a good[BR]
place to take a rest.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That big tree near my house is a[BR]
great place to get Goomnuts.[WAIT][END]

19-03B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These are the woods behind my[BR]
house.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Until a little while ago,[BR]
Goombaria and I used to play[BR]
hide-and-seek here...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But there have been a lot of[BR]
evil Goombas and Paragoombas[BR]
spotted in the area, so Mom[BR]
doesn't let us play anymore.[WAIT][END]

19-03C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I think this is Jr. Troopa's[BR]
secret base.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That crazy kid![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Whenever I try to explore in[BR]
there, he freaks out.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He needs to chill.[WAIT][END]

19-03D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These are the woods behind my[BR]
house.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Careful! There are many bad[BR]
Goombas around here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sorry... I'm sure that you can[BR]
probably take care of yourself,[BR]
huh?[WAIT][END]

19-03E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Did you know...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]...there are good Goombas and[BR]
bad Goombas?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A bad Goomba will try to pick[BR]
a fight with us the second it[BR]
spots us.[WAIT][END]

19-03F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look, [PAUSE:05]Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:05]There's a Save Block.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Might be a good idea to use it,[BR]
don't you think?[WAIT][END]

19-040
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}If we go east a bit farther,[BR]
we'll find a bridge.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Once we cross it, we'll be a hop,[BR]
skip and a jump away from Toad[BR]
Town.[WAIT][END]

19-041
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There're lots of bad Goombas[BR]
around these parts.[WAIT][END]

19-042
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I think there was a bridge[BR]
between Toad Town and Goomba[BR]
Village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we head east, we'll get to[BR]
Toad Town. If we head west,[BR]
we'll come to my house in Goomba[BR]
Village.[WAIT][END]

19-043
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ah, the outskirts of Toad Town.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To the east is Toad Town.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]If we go west, we'll reach my[BR]
hometown, Goomba Village.[WAIT][END]

19-044
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's your house![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Cool! Nice landscaping![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I like my house, but yours is even[BR]
nicer. Did you do the decorating[BR]
yourself?[WAIT][END]

19-045
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}To the west of here is Toad[BR]
Town,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]and to the east is Koopa Village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we go even farther east,[BR]
we'll eventually reach Koopa[BR]
Bros. Fortress.[WAIT][END]

19-046
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's always pleasant around[BR]
here. That's why we call this[BR]
place Pleasant Path.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's nice and warm today, too.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Incidentally, lots of Koopas[BR]
live around here.[WAIT][END]

19-047
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Koopas like to live around[BR]
Pleasant Path because there's[BR]
plenty of water for them to[BR]
lounge in.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Koopa Village is down this way.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you want to go to Koopa[BR]
Bros. Fortress, we should take[BR]
the upper path and just keep[BR]
going straight.[WAIT][END]

19-048
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Koopa Village.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Big surprise! Koopas live here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Recently it seems like some[BR]
Bob-ombs have moved here, too.[BR]
They must have run away from[BR]
the fortress, huh?[WAIT][END]

19-049
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The house with the yellowish[BR]
roof is the home of the famous[BR]
archaeologist and explorer,[BR]
Kolorado.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Kolorado's always running from[BR]
one mysterious place to another[BR]
in order to do research.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's really well respected in his[BR]
field.[WAIT][END]

19-04A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We'd better be careful. There[BR]
are supposedly lots of Fuzzies[BR]
around this area.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Usually they stay hidden, but[BR]
lately they're more aggressive.[WAIT][END]

19-04B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This part of the forest is the[BR]
Fuzzies' main stronghold.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The woods would actually be[BR]
quite beautiful if not for the [BR]
Fuzzies. The light's nice...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think Koopas do the[BR]
logging around here?[WAIT][END]

19-04C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}If we continue along the pass,[BR]
we should reach Koopa Bros.[BR]
Fortress.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Many Koopas and Paratroopas[BR]
live around here. If they're [BR]
loyal to Bowser, they'll[BR]
definitely attack us.[WAIT][END]

19-04D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Just east of here, we can see[BR]
Koopa Bros. Fortress.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Actually, we're probably already[BR]
on fortress grounds.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That arch certainly looks like[BR]
part of it. And there are lots[BR]
of bad guys, too.[WAIT][END]

19-04E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Here's Koopa Bros. Fortress.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This used to be ruined, but I[BR]
guess the Koopa Bros. rebuilt it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looks pretty huge, huh?[BR]
And solid, too.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This fortress was originally [BR]
built around the same time the [BR]
Bob-ombs took up residence on[BR]
Pleasant Path.[WAIT][END]

19-04F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's pretty chilly inside this[BR]
fortress, isn't it?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It must be because there's so[BR]
much water inside.[WAIT][END]

19-050
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This fortress stays cool all the[BR]
time because it's built entirely[BR]

19-051
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This seems to be the central[BR]
area of the fortress.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This area looks extremely[BR]
suspicious to me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder what all these gates[BR]
guard, [PAUSE:05]don't you, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-052
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I heard there are many tricky[BR]
parts of this castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder who built it.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's pretty curious looking.[WAIT][END]

19-053
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This place is pretty huge.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Before the Koopa Bros. came[BR]
here, this place used to be[BR]
filled with Bob-ombs. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't think the Bob-ombs[BR]
built it, but they became its[BR]
caretakers. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]they explode all the time, so[BR]
you can see why there are so[BR]
many cracked walls.[WAIT][END]

19-054
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It looks like they turned this[BR]
large chamber into a prison cell.[WAIT][END]

19-055
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It seems strange to keep so[BR]
much water in the building.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think it's here to keep[BR]
Bob-ombs from burning the place[BR]
down? Or maybe it's just for[BR]
Koopas to bathe in.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean, it's nice that it keeps[BR]
the place so cool, but I'm still[BR]
suspicious...[BR]
Mario... [PAUSE:05]Let's keep moving, huh?[WAIT][END]

19-056
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These fire bars are a menace![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They're hot to the touch. They'll[BR]
hurt you if you touch 'em.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Somebody said there's a way to [BR]
destroy 'em. How do you think[BR]
we do that?[WAIT][END]

19-057
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, the air is refreshing up[BR]
here, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And look at the view! Isn't that[BR]
Pleasant Path way down there? [WAIT][END]

19-058
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the room where we fought[BR]
the Koopa Bros.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Those guys weren't so tough![BR]
They certainly weren't a match [BR]
for us, huh, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-059
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the Mt. Rugged Station[BR]
on the Dry Dry Railroad line.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Not much grows around here or[BR]
on the barren mountain.[WAIT][END]

19-05A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What a steep mountain![WAIT][END]

19-05B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Watch out for the sneaky Monty[BR]
Moles that are common to this[BR]
area.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're dirty fighters. They pop[BR]
up from underground and chuck[BR]
rocks at people. The cowards![WAIT][END]

19-05C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Phew! Maybe we ought to take a[BR]
break! I didn't realize the road[BR]
up would be so rough![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, as nice as it would[BR]
be to take five on a rock, you[BR]
have to watch yourself. Enemies[BR]
disguise themselves as rocks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're nasty and spiky, so keep[BR]
your eyes open.[WAIT][END]

19-05D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh...I'm exhausted.[BR]
[PAUSE:08]Do we have to keep going? Can't[BR]
we chill for a bit?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Why'd this mountain have to be[BR]
so huge?[WAIT][END]

19-05E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Whoa! We're pretty high up![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Ooog... I feel a little faint.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I never told you this before, but[BR]
I have a fear of heights.[WAIT][END]

19-05F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the gateway between Mt.[BR]
Rugged and Dry Dry Desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we head due east from here,[BR]
we'll eventually reach the town[BR]
called Dry Dry Outpost.[WAIT][END]

19-060
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}So hot... I feel dizzy...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Where are we going again? Who[BR]
are you, anyway?[WAIT][END]

19-061
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}So...very...hot![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Anyone smell roasting Goomba?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Must...concentrate...[BR]
Many dangers in the desert...[BR]
Keep eyes open...[WAIT][END]

19-062
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We're going to get lost...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This desert seems endless.[WAIT][END]

19-063
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Dry Dry Ruins.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Weren't you totally blown away[BR]
when it rose out of the sand?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That was awesome! I wish we [BR]
could make it happen again![WAIT][END]

19-064
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Dry Dry Desert never ends.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]How big is it, anyway?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm beat. My feet hurt.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This sand feels like it's a[BR]
thousand degrees.[WAIT][END]

19-065
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know what I just realized?[BR]
I hate the desert! Yup! [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sand gets in my eyes so I can't[BR]
see. I feel like I've eaten a[BR]
couple pounds of sand, and my[BR]
feet itch.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm freaking out here![WAIT][END]

19-066
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ah, yes! Some more sand and[BR]
some more cacti![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How do you stand such a boring[BR]
landscape?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Look, when I signed on for this[BR]
adventure, I was under the[BR]
impression that there would be[BR]
no boredom involved.[WAIT][END]

19-067
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}{StartFX:Wavy}It's scorching, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm turning to charcoal![WAIT][END]

19-068
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I feel dazed... So thirsty...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]The cacti seem to be moving...[WAIT][END]

19-069
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know what? Traveling in the[BR]
desert is really hard.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Just moving my feet in the sand[BR]
is exhausting. I feel like I'm[BR]
stuck in quicksand. [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Are we even getting anywhere?[WAIT][END]

19-06A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hey, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Did you know that...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
cacti save water inside?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]That's the only way they can[BR]
survive out here.[WAIT][END]

19-06B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Does it ever rain in a desert[BR]
like this?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I seriously doubt it.[WAIT][END]

19-06C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}If there's too little rain, the[BR]
cacti will dry up.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did you know that?[WAIT][END]

19-06D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}So blue...the desert sky...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]They ought to call it...[BR]
"Big Ol' Super Blue Sky"![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think I'm delirious. It's so[BR]
hot out here, I can't think[BR]
straight.[WAIT][END]

19-06E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This looks almost exactly the[BR]
same as everywhere else.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Fine, so there're a few trees[BR]
growing here. Big deal! I still[BR]
hate this place![WAIT][END]

19-06F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's hot. The desert is hot.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't imagine that people would[BR]
actually choose to live in a place[BR]
like this.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't they get hot?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I guess some like it hot...[WAIT][END]

19-070
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I'm spent, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]No shade, no water, no nothing.[BR]
I hate this place. [WAIT][END]

19-071
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}All this blowing sand would cover[BR]
up most paths.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I don't even know which direction[BR]
we're moving.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we find that big path again,[BR]
let's stick to it so we don't get[BR]
lost again.[WAIT][END]

19-072
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Is there nothing here but sand,[BR]
rocks and cacti?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess we should be happy that[BR]
we're not in a sandstorm. I did[BR]
see a whirlwind, though.[WAIT][END]

19-073
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Mario... I'm so tired...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If we find a shady tree, let's[BR]
take a rest for a while...[WAIT][END]

19-074
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}How do trees grow here?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]When we find a big one, let's[BR]
take a rest for a while.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You wouldn't think that anything[BR]
could grow around here.[BR]
[PAUSE:03]These must be a hardy type of[BR]
tree, huh?[WAIT][END]

19-075
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We should be near Dry Dry[BR]
Outpost.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy, after the endless sands of[BR]
this desert, it'll be nice to put[BR]
our feet up in a town for a while.[WAIT][END]

19-076
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Kolorado is searching out[BR]
mysteries, as usual. He seems[BR]
to be looking for ruins here.[WAIT][END]

19-077
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Here... [PAUSE:03]I remember this spot.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's where that explorer,[BR]
Kolorado, used to have his[BR]
base camp set up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think he found what he[BR]
was looking for?[WAIT][END]

19-078
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}As long as we stick to the path,[BR]
it's easy to go from Mt. Rugged[BR]
to Dry Dry Outpost without[BR]
getting lost.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since so many people use this[BR]
path, the desert sands can't[BR]
cover it up.[WAIT][END]

19-079
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Traveling through places like[BR]
this desert really makes you[BR]
appreciate water.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm pretty thirsty right now.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Aren't you, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-07A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}In an area like this,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]it's tough to find things that[BR]
can serve as landmarks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But that rock in the shape of a[BR]
cactus is a pretty good one.[WAIT][END]

19-07B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Just putting one foot in front[BR]
of another is hard here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Whenever I take a break, I feel[BR]
like I don't want to move again.[WAIT][END]

19-07C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ah, a couple of trees are[BR]
growing here. It might just be[BR]
my imagination, but the air feels[BR]
a bit cooler right here.[WAIT][END]

19-07D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Just east of here is the desert[BR]
town, Dry Dry Outpost.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We'd better remember how to get[BR]
back here.[WAIT][END]

19-07E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The desert is filled with bandits[BR]
who love to steal coins from[BR]
travelers.[WAIT][END]

19-07F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}More rocks and sand! It'd be[BR]
really easy to get lost around[BR]
here.[WAIT][END]

19-080
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow! There's a whole lot of[BR]
nothing around here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Any idea which direction we[BR]
should take, [PAUSE:05]Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-081
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, it's smart to take a[BR]
nap when it gets too hot.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That reminds me of something my[BR]
mom used to say:[BR]
[PAUSE:05]"Take a nap, will you!"[WAIT][END]

19-082
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look, it's unbearably hot out. I'm[BR]
getting pretty fed up with it, if[BR]
you want to know the truth...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Isn't there somewhere we can[BR]
stop for a rest? [WAIT][END]

19-083
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at that rocky plateau.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It looks like it's too high to[BR]
climb, but I can almost see[BR]
something good up there...[WAIT][END]

19-084
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look! Look, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's actually some grass[BR]
growing around here![WAIT][END]

19-085
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, there sure are a lot[BR]
of rocks in the desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Before I came here, I thought[BR]
there was just sand. But there[BR]
are rocks, too. Whoopee.[WAIT][END]

19-086
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Cacti also have flowers, did you[BR]
know that?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I haven't seen any, though...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do people eat cacti?[WAIT][END]

19-087
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The desert wind constantly[BR]
builds up and tears down the[BR]
sand dunes.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They say it constantly changes,[BR]
but it pretty much looks the[BR]
same to me all the time.[WAIT][END]

19-088
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There are big cacti around here.[WAIT][END]

19-089
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hey, Mario?[BR]
Are you thirsty at all?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm parched. Really thirsty.[BR]
Totally dried up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:14]Wait a minute...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]My mouth is really dry! Maybe[BR]
that's why they call it Dry Dry[BR]
Desert![WAIT][END]

19-08A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look! Look, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's actually some grass[BR]
growing around here![WAIT][END]

19-08B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh...thank heavens![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]At last, we've found an oasis![BR]
It's not a mirage, is it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The trees are so green! The[BR]
water, so blue! Hurray![WAIT][END]

19-08C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}So hot...so very, very hot...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This desert trip...[BR]
{StartFX:Jitter}I can't take it anymore![BR]
{EndFX:Jitter}[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]let's find some shade and relax[BR]
for a while, huh?[WAIT][END]

19-08D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}If we get lost in the desert,[BR]
we'll dry up and turn into[BR]
mummies.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How about it? Let's rest by that[BR]
small rock.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Maybe there's something unusual[BR]
about that rock...[WAIT][END]

19-08E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Mario, aren't you hungry? How[BR]
about thirsty? Tired?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm all of those things.[WAIT][END]

19-08F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}W... Water...[BR]
Must have water...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm so thirsty I could bite a[BR]
cactus...[WAIT][END]

19-090
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Do you think there are any other[BR]
mysteries in this desert besides[BR]
the ruins?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It'd be nice if we stumbled upon[BR]
some treasure or something.[WAIT][END]

19-091
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}No matter where we go, all I see[BR]
is sand.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That's what this is like. A sea of[BR]
sand.[WAIT][END]

19-092
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We're lucky we have hats on.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We'd probably have come down[BR]
with sunstroke by now if we[BR]
hadn't had our hats.[WAIT][END]

19-093
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Dry Dry Outpost.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Lots of Dryites and Nomadimice[BR]
live here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm so happy to find civilization[BR]
after crossing that desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Despite the climate, lots of[BR]
travelers seem to come here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Still, they can't get that many[BR]
tourists. It's too hot![WAIT][END]

19-094
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I heard that this town was[BR]
originally founded by thieves[BR]
from the desert.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a pretty mysterious town,[BR]
don't you think?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are all kinds of stories[BR]
and legends about this place.[BR]
The residents around here love[BR]
all those old tales.[WAIT][END]

19-095
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's the entrance to Dry Dry[BR]
Ruins. It's called the illusion[BR]
ruin.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Nobody could find this place for[BR]
ages. But we did![WAIT][END]

19-096
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Legend has it that there are[BR]
many traps and puzzles in these[BR]
ruins.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When this was a great palace,[BR]
the keepers set all the traps[BR]
up to keep looters from stealing[BR]
their treasures.[WAIT][END]

19-097
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Compared to the desert, it's[BR]
cool in here.[WAIT][END]

19-098
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's a great view of the[BR]
desert from the upstairs floor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The farther down we go,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]the cooler it'll get. It'll get[BR]
darker, too, though.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Should we go down there?[WAIT][END]

19-099
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Now that I've helped you find [BR]
Dry Dry Ruins, will I become[BR]
famous, too?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You don't care. You're already[BR]
a household name.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmmph.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hey, a picture of some Chomps.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe there are Chomps[BR]
guarding these ruins.[WAIT][END]

19-09A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a bit sandy, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Well, when you're buried in the[BR]
desert, you pick up some sand.[WAIT][END]

19-09B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's amazing that these ruins[BR]
still have moving parts.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Haven't they been buried here[BR]
for ages and ages?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And yet, when we push switches,[BR]
stuff moves...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Amazing craftsmanship. You've[BR]
gotta applaud the designers.[WAIT][END]

19-09C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}My mouth is so dry...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I feel like I ate dust.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I feel like my skin is cracking[BR]
off and my eyes are turning [BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
D'you have any moisturizer?[WAIT][END]

19-09D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at these stairways![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How do they make 'em revolve?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Whoever built this place must[BR]
have been brilliant.[WAIT][END]

19-09E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I'm sure that ruins like these[BR]
are full of hidden rooms.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We should keep our eyes open for[BR]
anything suspicious.[WAIT][END]

19-09F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at the Chomp statues![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Even though I know they're just[BR]
statues, they still scare me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This seems to be the very center[BR]
of the ruins.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In case I haven't mentioned it[BR]
before, the architects of this[BR]
place were geniuses.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Moustafa's ancestors must have[BR]
been amazing people.[WAIT][END]

19-0A0
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I'm pretty beat.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Phew[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03]. [PAUSE:05]Well, heroes don't take[BR]
rests, I guess.[WAIT][END]

19-0A1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I feel hungry for some reason.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did you hear that? My belly[BR]
is making sounds like a Chomp![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy, a cold drink and a hot[BR]
sandwich would taste good.[WAIT][END]

19-0A2
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I knew this place would have[BR]
lots of hidden areas.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ancient palaces always do![BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's like a law of ancient[BR]
architecture, I think.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And by the way, there's always[BR]
supposed to be treasure, too.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wouldn't mind finding[BR]
something nice...[WAIT][END]

19-0A3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Tutankoopa's old lair.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That guy wasn't so tough.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You're much tougher, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't believe Tutankoopa was[BR]
the master here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This kingdom was originally[BR]
built by Nomadimice, many[BR]
generations ago. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll tell you, Tutankoopa didn't[BR]
look much like a Nomadimouse.[WAIT][END]

19-0A4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's pretty dark around here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We'd better be careful not to[BR]
get lost or ambushed.[WAIT][END]

19-0A5
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We'd better get ready for a[BR]

19-0A6
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}If we go east, we'll get to the[BR]
entrance of Forever Forest.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]If we go west, we'll hit Toad[BR]
Town. Remember?[WAIT][END]

19-0A7
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy... This forest is really dark[BR]
and spooky.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
People say that if you don't[BR]
choose exactly the right paths,[BR]
you'll get totally lost.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can believe it. This looks like[BR]
the type of place where you get[BR]
lost and then monsters come out[BR]
of the grass and...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey![BR]
[PAUSE:08]{StartFX:Jitter}Did you notice that grass over[BR]

19-0A8
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}{StartFX:Jitter}Mario...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't look now, but I think I[BR]

the hole in that tree. [WAIT][END]

19-0A9
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The flowers in this forest are[BR]
unusual, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]They're strangely colored, and[BR]
they look creepy when they move.[BR]

I think I saw some that were a[BR]

[PAUSE:08]Did you see 'em?[WAIT][END]

19-0AA
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The trees in this forest are[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]I've heard sometimes they smile[BR]
wickedly...[BR]

I'll tell you, if I see a tree[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Is it just my imagination or is[BR]
it getting darker?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Are we going the right way?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm getting a little worried.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There seem to be a lot of[BR]
strange glowing mushrooms[BR]
around these tree trunks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy! They're everywhere![BR]
Must be an infestation...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It kind of looks like one[BR]
mushroom patch is slightly[BR]
different from the others.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My mind may just be playing[BR]
tricks on me, though.[WAIT][END]

19-0AC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What kind of evil flowers would[BR]
grow in a place like this?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]When we approach, some seem to[BR]
shrink, while others just grin...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{StartFX:Jitter}But...but I'm not scared.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I mean it, Mario![BR]
I told you that they don't scare[BR]
me! All right?[WAIT][END]

19-0AD
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Where are we?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
After making so many turns on[BR]
different paths, I'm getting[BR]
confused as to which way is up.[BR]
Aren't there any signs? [WAIT][END]

19-0AE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look, I'm sick of this forest, all[BR]
right? Let's get out of here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't care how many important[BR]
things are hidden in this forest,[BR]
I can't spend another instant in[BR]
the freaky place![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Look, I know I saw a beehive.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's make the beehive a[BR]
landmark. OK?[WAIT][END]

19-0AF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This all looks the same to me.[BR]
Gloomy trees that seem to go on[BR]
forever. Seems like they found[BR]
the perfect name for this place.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
By the way, did you hear[BR]
something in that bush?[WAIT][END]

19-0B0
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Boo's Mansion.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Great name for a haunted house,[BR]
don't you think?[WAIT][END]

19-0B1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the back gate to Boo's[BR]
Mansion.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As far as I can tell, this is[BR]
the edge of Gusty Gulch. Tubba[BR]
Blubba's Castle is up on the hill.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's amazing how the scenery[BR]
changes from forest to gulch[BR]
so quickly.[WAIT][END]

19-0B2
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What a magnificent mansion![BR]
Being haunted must hurt the[BR]
real estate value, though...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I like the old-fashioned yet[BR]
eerie style.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The chandelier and the display[BR]
case look like they're valuable[BR]
antiques.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even the sofa in the foyer looks[BR]
like it's pricey, even though[BR]
it's a bit worn.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I love antiques.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wouldn't mind taking a good[BR]
look at those things.[WAIT][END]

19-0B3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The blue light is spooky in here,[BR]
but you can tell that this room[BR]
is really nice.[BR]
[PAUSE:08][WAIT][NEXT]
It feels like [PAUSE:05]something [PAUSE:05]is[BR]
[PAUSE:05]watching [PAUSE:05]us.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It feels like that everywhere.[BR]
It's almost as if this haunted[BR]
mansion is...haunted.[WAIT][END]

19-0B4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}A storage room... [PAUSE:05]isn't it?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You'd think those candles[BR]
would provide a bit more light.[WAIT][END]

19-0B5
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Another storage room, I guess.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Not a whole lot here, as far as[BR]
I can tell.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F][WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, incidentally,[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]what happened to the door...? [WAIT][END]

19-0B6
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This room does have a lot of[BR]
space, but it's still a shame[BR]
to use it for storage.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That pot and those wooden[BR]
boxes look suspicious...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's also a weakened spot[BR]
on the floor.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Look...[PAUSE:05]under the chandelier.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, check it out![BR]
A real old rocking chair![BR]
These things rule! [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It rocks back and forth when[BR]
you sit on it. I love napping[BR]
in these.[WAIT][END]

19-0B7
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There certainly seem to be a[BR]
lot of books.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I didn't know Boos liked books.[WAIT][END]

19-0B8
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hey, [PAUSE:05]that strange contraption[BR]
at the back of the room is a[BR]
phonograph.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, a machine for[BR]
listening to records.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Have you seen any records[BR]
around here?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wouldn't mind doing a little[BR]
adventuring to the timeless[BR]
classic, "Mario's Theme"![WAIT][END]

19-0B9
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow![BR]
[PAUSE:05]What a gorgeous chandelier![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If they actually cleaned it,[BR]
it would brighten this place up.[WAIT][END]

19-0BA
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the highest room in the[BR]
mansion.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm guessing it's Bow's room.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]She seems like the type to live[BR]
in a huge room.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you look at this room, it's[BR]
pretty obvious that Bow was[BR]
raised by a really wealthy family[BR]
of Boos.[WAIT][END]

19-0BB
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's a windmill.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Those vanes are turning really[BR]
slowly.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]The sound of it turning is sort[BR]
of lonely...[WAIT][END]

19-0BC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Somebody told me if a house is[BR]
dilapidated, it means it's[BR]
crumbly and deserted.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That sounds like this place.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Goompa said Boos love this sort[BR]
of place.[WAIT][END]

19-0BD
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The way that house leans is[BR]
bizarre, isn't it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Why do Boos like homes like[BR]
these?[WAIT][END]

19-0BE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Gusty Gulch.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Watch your step on the rocky[BR]
slopes.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You also have to beware of[BR]
strange creatures.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]My dad would say that going[BR]
through here builds character...[WAIT][END]

19-0BF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Gusty Gulch.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It looks like there's a gap over[BR]
there that won't be easy to[BR]
cross. You'll need some help.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's be quick but careful. I[BR]
don't like the looks of the[BR]
creatures around here.[WAIT][END]

19-0C0
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We've reached the top of[BR]
Gusty Gulch.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That building is Tubba Blubba's[BR]
Castle, isn't it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The land here is totally barren.[BR]
Was it always like this?[WAIT][END]

19-0C1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What a huge hall![BR]
[PAUSE:03]Looks like it's crumbling, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy, if this main hall collapses,[BR]
the entire castle will follow.[BR]
This whole place looks like it's[BR]
falling apart.[WAIT][END]

19-0C2
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a corridor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure it was really [BR]
magnificent before Tubba[BR]
Blubba let it get filthy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can barely see the beauty[BR]
beneath the dirt.[WAIT][END]

19-0C3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow! This room is huge![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I guess Tubba Blubba's pretty[BR]
big, though, so it's probably[BR]
just the right size.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
High ceilings really make a[BR]
room feel luxurious.[WAIT][END]

19-0C4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There're the stairs.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Even the staircases are big.[BR]
This place is monstrous. [WAIT][END]

19-0C5
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There're the stairs.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Ugh! A cobweb![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I just can't stand creatures[BR]
that don't tidy up...[WAIT][END]

19-0C6
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a basement, isn't it?[BR]
[PAUSE:03]Yup...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]and a big one, too. This makes[BR]
a great hiding place.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't think Clubbas patrol[BR]
down here, so it's probably [BR]
safe to rest for a while.[WAIT][END]

19-0C7
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ooh! The dining room set here[BR]
is fantastic![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If they got curtains that[BR]
weren't so old, they could[BR]
really bring the room together.[WAIT][END]

19-0C8
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This castle's too big...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm so tired.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]All we ever do is walk...[WAIT][END]

19-0C9
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, even the huge cracks[BR]
in the walls don't bother me[BR]
that much.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But spiderwebs? C'mon, a little[BR]
housecleaning, people![WAIT][END]

19-0CA
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You think Tubba Blubba likes this[BR]
castle?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If he did, you'd think he could[BR]
spend a little time fixing it up.[BR]
I mean, an occasional cleaning...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What a waste.[WAIT][END]

19-0CB
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Filthy as it is, this castle has[BR]
surprisingly little dust.[WAIT][END]

19-0CC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Whoa![BR]
Spikes in the floor![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Don't try to jump over 'em![BR]
There are too many![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How can we get through without[BR]
being hurt by the spikes?[WAIT][END]

19-0CD
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh, here we go! A chair tipped[BR]
over, a drawer left open...[BR]
Doesn't anyone ever clean [BR]
around here?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
While we're here, though, let's[BR]
take a closer look at that[BR]
drawer.[WAIT][END]

19-0CE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ugh...more stairs...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Up and down, up and down...[BR]
Will it never end?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's just a little tiring,[BR]
that's all.[WAIT][END]

19-0CF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We've been in here a while.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wouldn't mind having a house[BR]
this huge. Of course, it's kind[BR]
of a pain to have to walk so far[BR]
between rooms.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We could get an awesome game of[BR]
hide and seek going in here, but[BR]
I guess kids might get lost[BR]
pretty easily.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I wouldn't get lost, of course.[WAIT][END]

19-0D0
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What is this, a Clubba nap room?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]If we don't disturb 'em, maybe[BR]
they won't wake up. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But [PAUSE:05]sshh...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We must go slow and be quiet...[WAIT][END]

19-0D1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is only a corridor but it's[BR]
as big as an ordinary room.[BR]
Is that necessary?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This area alone might be bigger[BR]
than my entire house.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]That makes me mad for some[BR]
reason.[WAIT][END]

19-0D2
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hey look! A table, a bed,[BR]
a chest and a drawer.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is the only tasteful room[BR]
in the place! Everything is so[BR]
elegantly coordinated.[WAIT][END]

19-0D3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I haven't been in many windmills,[BR]
but this one seems weird.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Isn't this a well sitting in the[BR]
middle of it?[WAIT][END]

19-0D4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I guess the well's dry.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Lucky for us.[WAIT][END]

19-0D5
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You can tell from the dampness[BR]
that there used to be water in[BR]
this well.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The rocks are also moist to the[BR]
touch.[WAIT][END]

19-0D6
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You wouldn't expect there to be[BR]
such a nice walkway in a place[BR]
like this.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's so neat. It doesn't look[BR]
like it's a natural path.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Somebody must take care of it...[WAIT][END]

19-0D7
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Something important has just got[BR]
to be back here. Nobody would[BR]
dig such a long tunnel for[BR]
nothing...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What do you think it could[BR]
possibly be, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-0D8
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the very end of the[BR]
tunnel in the well.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It seems to be a big dead end.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This really is the perfect spot[BR]
for hiding something really[BR]
valuable.[WAIT][END]

19-0D9
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This seems to be a playroom for[BR]
Shy Guys.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They don't have to answer to[BR]
anybody down here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I envy these guys...[WAIT][END]

19-0DA
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow! Just like a real toy box.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Look! There are building blocks [BR]
lying around everywhere.[WAIT][END]

19-0DB
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Say...are we actually inside the[BR]
Toy Box right now?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How could all this be inside that[BR]
little box? Best not to think[BR]
about it too much...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Looks like this is Blue Station.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's a train station.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think if we use that jump pad[BR]
we can go back to Toad Town[BR]
whenever we want.[WAIT][END]

19-0DC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at all the doodles on the[BR]
walls![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Did Shy Guys draw all these?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They're kind of cute.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I didn't know that Shy Guys had[BR]
a cute side.[WAIT][END]

19-0DD
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look! There are moving panels[BR]
on the walls and [PAUSE:05]even a railroad[BR]
crossing.[BR]
What a fun room![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wish I could play here![WAIT][END]

19-0DE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Pink Station! Pink Station![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's the switch to[BR]
change the tracks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have to admit, this Toy Box is[BR]
a pretty cool place.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If I told Goombaria about this,[BR]
I'm sure she would be so jealous.[WAIT][END]

19-0DF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Over, around, up and back...[BR]
It's like a maze in here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Still, since we're inside a Toy[BR]
Box, I'm enjoying myself.[WAIT][END]

19-0E0
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hey, it's Green Station![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This train takes us to all the[BR]
stations.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy, if we could go anywhere by[BR]
just pushing a button, traveling[BR]
would be a dream, don't you[BR]
think?[WAIT][END]

19-0E1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Somebody told me...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Bow can easily avoid all kinds[BR]
of enemy attacks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What a cool skill![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wish I had that kind of useful[BR]
talent.[WAIT][END]

19-0E2
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Red Station.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]First Blue, then Pink, then Green[BR]
and finally Red.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a pretty cute touch, naming[BR]
stations after colors.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
By the looks of this place, I'd[BR]
say that Shy Guys like cuteness.[BR]
They even look like cute kids![WAIT][END]

19-0E3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The walls here are made of[BR]
gigantic colored blocks.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Luckily, there also seem to be[BR]
several elevators.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What do you think we'll see if[BR]
we ride them?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I say we find out.[WAIT][END]

19-0E4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Uh... I do believe it's dark.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Isn't there a light switch in this[BR]
place?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I can't see anything at all.[WAIT][END]

19-0E5
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I wonder who made this Toy Box.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I assume Shy Guys made it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They have such cool toys... I wish[BR]
I could befriend 'em, but I guess[BR]
they're too mischievous.[WAIT][END]

19-0E6
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's really dark in here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I can't see a thing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I feel like somebody could be[BR]
right next to me and I wouldn't[BR]
even know it. Yikes![WAIT][END]

19-0E7
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is quite an open space.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It kind of resembles a toy[BR]
arena, don't you think?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Remember those Shy Guys we[BR]
fought here? They were tough.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]they weren't as tough as us.[WAIT][END]

19-0E8
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The walls here are so fancy and[BR]
fun to look at.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]What a cool place![WAIT][END]

19-0E9
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This whale's tongue is squishy.[BR]
It makes it hard to walk.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's also kind of dark...[WAIT][END]

19-0EA
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's completely dark. I can't[BR]
see a thing,[BR]
Mario! [PAUSE:0A]What's up ahead?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, being inside a whale[BR]
belly is gross...[BR]
Damp... Squishy...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Let's never do this again.[WAIT][END]

19-0EB
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is where the whale comes[BR]
and goes![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Riding the whale sure was fun![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is where all travelers[BR]
first set foot on the beach of[BR]
Lavalava Island.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Beautiful water... Deep, lush[BR]
jungles... A huge volcano...[BR]
There's something for everyone![WAIT][END]

19-0EC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These beaches seem to go on[BR]
forever, don't they?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've never seen some of these[BR]
flowers. They're sure pretty![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I should look for some shells[BR]
if we have time later.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm going to take flowers and[BR]
shells back to Goombaria.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]She'll be happy...and she'll[BR]
also be jealous. Ha ha ha![WAIT][END]

19-0ED
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Yoshis seem to love the beach.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Just looking at those guys[BR]
basking in the sun makes me[BR]
feel very relaxed.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And yet, even though I'd love[BR]
to just sleep on the beach, I'm[BR]
excited to move on.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Nothing compares to adventure,[BR]
that's for sure![WAIT][END]

19-0EE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's a real tropical resort[BR]
atmosphere here, isn't there?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's a nice Toad House with[BR]
beach access, and you can go to[BR]
the volcano or Jade Jungle.[WAIT][END]

19-0EF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The entrance to the volcano is[BR]
very near here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A green jungle, a massive[BR]
volcano and red-hot, flowing[BR]
lava. What a view![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It probably wouldn't look so[BR]
good if the lava were coming[BR]
toward us.[WAIT][END]

19-0F0
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Sometimes crossing bridges is[BR]
the only way to reach certain[BR]
islands.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems like a pain, but what[BR]
are you gonna do?[WAIT][END]

19-0F1
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is where we saved Sushie[BR]
when she was caught up in that[BR]
tree.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Waa ha ha ha...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I just can't help laughing when[BR]
I remember that![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Please don't tell her I laughed[BR]
about it, Mario![WAIT][END]

19-0F2
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I thought jungles were supposed[BR]
to be all trees, but this one's[BR]
full of water.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Are all jungles like this?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looks like we can't reach the[BR]
other shore from here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]We'll have to find another way.[WAIT][END]

19-0F3
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I can't imagine what those Yoshi[BR]
kids were thinking...[BR]
...playing in a place like this...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm not surprised, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Kids! Always up to something![BR]
Besides, it's natural to want[BR]
to go on an adventure.[WAIT][END]

19-0F4
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We're in Jade Jungle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Quite a lot of water, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since there's no bridge,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]we'll have to find another way[BR]
to get around.[WAIT][END]

19-0F5
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That rotating flower down by[BR]
that ledge? Locals call it a[BR]
Spinning Flower.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you spin around on top of[BR]
that flower, I hear that you can[BR]
float upward.[WAIT][END]

19-0F6
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}For a jungle, there sure aren't[BR]
many trees around.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It gets brutally hot here[BR]
whenever the sun shines directly[BR]
on me.[WAIT][END]

19-0F7
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}My, it's bright here![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This must be on the outskirts of[BR]
the jungle, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Incidentally, I have no idea[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]how those Yoshi kids could come[BR]
this deep into the jungle.[WAIT][END]

19-0F8
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's a big Raven's statue.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You gotta figure... A big statue[BR]
this deep in the jungle...[BR]
I bet it's important.[WAIT][END]

19-0F9
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I bet only jungle explorers know[BR]
about this hidden underground[BR]
chamber.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's so dark in here I can't see[BR]
a thing.[WAIT][END]

19-0FA
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ooh...it's darker in here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]The trees are much thicker and[BR]
that bizarre ivy seems to be[BR]
growing everywhere.[WAIT][END]

19-0FB
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What cool little fountains![BR]
Must be an underground spring.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we push these blocks over the[BR]
holes to seal 'em, what'll happen[BR]
to the water?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think it'll come out from[BR]
another hole?[WAIT][END]

19-0FC
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Looks like some of the ivy is[BR]
hanging off the trees here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wonder what would happen if[BR]
you pulled on it?[WAIT][END]

19-0FD
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What part of Jade Jungle are[BR]
we in?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm thinking we're deep in the[BR]
inner jungle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think I hear something.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]From just ahead, I can almost[BR]
hear mysterious voices...[WAIT][END]

19-0FE
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What a huge tree![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This definitely must be the[BR]
biggest tree in Jade Jungle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How old must it be?[WAIT][END]

19-0FF
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's so spacious in here![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I can't believe we're inside a[BR]
tree right now.[WAIT][END]

19-100
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Whoa! We're way up high![BR]
[PAUSE:05]The jungle floor looks so tiny[BR]
from here! [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Gulp! Have I mentioned before[BR]
that I hate heights?[WAIT][END]

19-101
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I can't get over how huge the[BR]
inside of this tree is! It's[BR]
enormous! It's mammoth![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And another thing, it's giant![WAIT][END]

19-102
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This appears to be the nest of[BR]
Raphael the Raven.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He's the guardian of Jade[BR]

This nest is really sturdy. It[BR]

19-103
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is definitely the entrance[BR]
to the volcano.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]What do you say we explore[BR]
deeper inside?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The scenery around here is[BR]
unlike anything I've ever seen.[BR]
I wish we had time to inspect it![WAIT][END]

19-104
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Now that...is a lot of lava.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Did you know it'd be this hot?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]And we have to cross here, don't[BR]
we? I knew it.[WAIT][END]

19-105
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a big cavern.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I've heard that some volcanoes[BR]
have caverns that go down for[BR]
miles and miles![WAIT][END]

19-106
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These Fire Bars are a huge pain,[BR]
aren't they, Mario?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]We can get by 'em. Don't worry.[WAIT][END]

19-107
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a steep slope.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We have to press on, but I'm [BR]
getting a little tired going over[BR]
over such rough road.[WAIT][END]

19-108
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, if it weren't for that[BR]
lava, it'd be dark in here.[WAIT][END]

19-109
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, this lava is everywhere![BR]
How are we gonna cross it?[WAIT][END]

19-10A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, we're real spelunkers,[BR]
aren't we? My Goompa told me[BR]
that means cave-explorer.[BR]
Kind of like Kolorado![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder how he manages,[BR]
exploring all by himself?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]At least we have each other.[WAIT][END]

19-10B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a pit if I ever saw one.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's a big one, too. If we're not[BR]
careful, we could get lost. [WAIT][END]

19-10C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a really steep slope.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]If we dropped something here,[BR]
gravity would make it roll down.[WAIT][END]

19-10D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's like a sea filled with lava.[BR]

19-10E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We need to go east from here.[BR]
It's a good thing that it's just[BR]
light enough to see. [WAIT][END]

19-10F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This cavern is lit by the lava[BR]
below, so the upper level is[BR]
slightly darker.[WAIT][END]

19-110
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Lava has filled in the floor down[BR]
there, so we can't go back down.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Too bad! Well, I guess we should[BR]
be moving on--with any luck to [BR]
someplace a lot cooler![WAIT][END]

19-111
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's hot, hot, [PAUSE:05]scorching hot![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's like being slowly cooked[BR]
from the bottom up![BR]
In hot grease! On a hot day![BR]
I can't take it anymore![WAIT][END]

19-112
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This place is shaking itself to[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The lava's overflowing...[BR]
[PAUSE:08]We're never gonna make it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What are we gonna do??[WAIT][END]

19-114
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the portal between the[BR]

Flower Fields. [BR]

The Wise Wisterwood, who's the[BR]

19-116
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What crystal-clear water![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Just looking at it refreshes me![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I feel like a new Goomba![WAIT][END]

19-117
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I guess they couldn't call it[BR]
Flower Fields without flowers.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Me, I'd rather have some tasty[BR]
fruit than pretty flowers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As short as I am, when we walk[BR]
through flowers, I can't see[BR]
a thing! And I have allergies![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's not a whole lot of fun.[WAIT][END]

19-118
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's another platform up[BR]
there, but I don't think we can[BR]
get up there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I hate these flower patches![BR]
They totally cover me![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Those three trees seem to be[BR]
important to me. If we hit 'em[BR]
right, something might drop.[WAIT][END]

19-119
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It looks like there hasn't been[BR]
water here in a while.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And there's just one flower.[BR]
How very sad.[WAIT][END]

19-11A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Lily looks happy in her[BR]
replenished spring, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's so much more beautiful here[BR]
when there's water flowing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think this water flows to[BR]
all parts of Flower Fields?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've heard that this water is[BR]
absolutely bursting with healthy[BR]
nutrients.[WAIT][END]

19-11B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a hedge maze.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I hope we don't get lost. I'm not[BR]
very good at mazes. Still, I know[BR]
you'll get us through all right.[BR]
You're Mario![WAIT][END]

19-11C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Oh, I love rose gardens![BR]
Roses are just the best.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Although they do have thorns,[BR]
don't they?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
All of the most beautiful flowers[BR]
have thorns. At least that's[BR]
what they say.[WAIT][END]

19-11D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This area is full of flowers.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Red flowers, blue flowers,[BR]
yellow flowers...even orange[BR]
flowers are blooming.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looks like there are a lot of[BR]
Lakitus in bloom, too.[WAIT][END]

19-11E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look, a flower blowing lots of[BR]
bubbles![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Will wonders never cease?[WAIT][END]

19-11F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's the Sun Tower.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is where the sun comes to[BR]
rest.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Do you think it's waiting here or[BR]
being forced to stay?[WAIT][END]

19-120
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Green, purple and red...[BR]
the platforms are all different[BR]
colors.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you jump on them hard, they'll[BR]
move up and down.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We need to figure out the right[BR]
order to move them in.[WAIT][END]

19-121
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There are flower patches[BR]
bordering this path.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looks peaceful, but there are[BR]
lots of briar patches and[BR]
enemies around, so be careful.[WAIT][END]

19-122
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What happened to the wall here?[BR]
It looks like it collapsed.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This place seems very different[BR]
from the rest of Flower Fields.[WAIT][END]

19-123
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Wow! We're in the clouds![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We're floating!. It feels comfy,[BR]
but I just don't quite trust it.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Mario,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
am I sinking? Am I?[WAIT][END]

19-124
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We're way up in the air.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Since we're on a cloud, we must[BR]
be close to Star Haven.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think the Star Spirits[BR]
are OK?[WAIT][END]

19-125
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}A tree's been cut down here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]And there's a well. Do you think[BR]
we can get water from there?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You never know, something might[BR]
be living in there...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]What if something weird jumps[BR]
out at us? Well, it could![WAIT][END]

19-126
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at all the flowers.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Even the flowers blooming along[BR]
the road are beautiful here in[BR]
Flower Fields.[WAIT][END]

19-127
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, if you like flowers, this is[BR]
the place to be. Look at all the[BR]
foliage![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, by the way, blue trees[BR]
produce Bubble Berries.[WAIT][END]

19-128
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Since it's called Flower Fields,[BR]
you know there have to be lots[BR]
of flowers around here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But there are also a few trees.[WAIT][END]

19-129
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I heard from Goompa that Shiver[BR]
City is covered with snow all[BR]
year round.[WAIT][END]

19-12A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Shiver City.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's usually completely covered[BR]
with snow and ice.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's perfect for penguins.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's a bit cold for me.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]You seem to be fine, though.[BR]
How do you do it, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-12B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It looks like we could go skating[BR]
on that frozen pond.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Skating is tons of fun![BR]
I don't know, though... Do you[BR]
think that ice might break?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, [PAUSE:05]you might also notice that[BR]
gate over there. It leads out[BR]
into the highlands.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The path from that gate leads[BR]
all the way to Starborn Valley.[WAIT][END]

19-12C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's too bad we broke the ice in [BR]
that pond, huh? Now we can't go[BR]
skating![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What a pity![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That gate is the way between[BR]
the village and the cold hills[BR]
beyond. A guard is always[BR]
stationed there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you follow the path from that[BR]
gate, eventually you'll come to[BR]
Starborn Valley.[WAIT][END]

19-12D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This path is pretty clear of[BR]
snow, don't you think?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think people clear it off,[BR]
or does the snow just melt?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Bit of a mystery,[BR]
eh, Mario?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder if the good citizens[BR]
of Shiver City have an answer[BR]
for it...[WAIT][END]

19-12E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at all those snowmen[BR]
standing in a line.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder who made them...[BR]
And why. They kind of look like[BR]
they're watching the path.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They look pretty cold, too...[BR]
but I guess snowmen like cold.[WAIT][END]

19-12F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I think we're still on the path,[BR]
but it feels more wild here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we travel east from here,[BR]
we'll hit Starborn Valley.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Shiver City is way off to the[BR]
west.[WAIT][END]

19-130
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Starborn Valley.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Merle makes his home here, along[BR]
with Ninjis and Toads.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They look after Star Kids until[BR]
they go up to the sky.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It must be a hard work.[WAIT][END]

19-131
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is Shiver Mountain.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This is a very cold, dangerous[BR]
climb.[BR]
Be careful. [PAUSE:05]OK, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-132
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I feel like we're on the edge of[BR]
the world up here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Seriously! This is a really[BR]
remote place to go adventuring![WAIT][END]

19-133
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, climbing this mountain is[BR]
really hard![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You'd think the path to a palace[BR]
dedicated to the Stars would be[BR]
a lot less trying on the legs.[WAIT][END]

19-134
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Walk carefully up here or else[BR]
you may slip, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That would be a long, long way[BR]
down, huh?[WAIT][END]

19-135
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}What a strange place this is![BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's bright even in the cave...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
This must be the small cave that[BR]
Merle told us about.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's something strange about[BR]
this place...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Even the walls seem suspicious[BR]
to me for some reason.[WAIT][END]

19-136
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is the door to the Crystal[BR]
Palace.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]We can get in from here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It must've been tough to get[BR]
building materials up here![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't you think it would've [BR]
been more convenient if they[BR]
had built it at a lower[BR]
elevation?[WAIT][END]

19-137
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}So spacious![BR]
[PAUSE:05]You gotta love the high ceilings,[BR]
huh, Mario?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You could set up a basketball[BR]
court in here![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The rich really know how to live![WAIT][END]

19-138
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This room is pretty cramped.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I wonder what it was used for.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Servants quarters, maybe?[WAIT][END]

19-139
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Is this like a waiting room?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I don't know how people could[BR]
deal with so many rooms. It's[BR]
totally confusing.[WAIT][END]

19-13A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Even though we're indoors, it's[BR]
still freezing in here![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I mean, seriously, the floor's[BR]
frozen.[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03]. [PAUSE:05]I hate it.[WAIT][END]

19-13B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy, these rooms all seem to look[BR]
alike, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems symmetrical. You know,[BR]
the left side is a mirror image[BR]
of the right side.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It'll be really easy to get lost[BR]
in here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Continue with care. [PAUSE:05]OK, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-13C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a long corridor, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even the wallpaper around here[BR]
looks frozen.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Although I do very much like the[BR]
star pattern.[WAIT][END]

19-13D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a long corridor, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Hey! That's our reflection in the[BR]
floor! It's like a mirror![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This place almost makes me miss[BR]
the desert. I'm freezing![BR]
How can you stand it?[WAIT][END]

19-13E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:05]have you noticed our reflection[BR]
on the floor?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't trust a floor this shiny.[BR]
I bet it's slippery.[WAIT][END]

19-13F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Talk about cold! My knees are[BR]
knocking! My teeth are[BR]
chattering![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't you have any problems[BR]
at all, Mario?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Let's keep moving so I don't [BR]
freeze into a Goombsicle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I've had all I can stand...[BR]
{StartFX:Shrinking}...must leave this fridge...[WAIT][END]

19-140
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It looks like your basic passage.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Since we're in a palace, I'll call[BR]
it a palatial passage. [WAIT][END]

19-141
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Strange... The reflected room[BR]
looks slightly different...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Funny, huh[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[BR]
[PAUSE:05][WAIT][END]

19-142
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ah-ha! [PAUSE:0A]It's a cave, isn't it?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's nice to get a breath of[BR]
fresh air, but I must say that[BR]
it's even colder out here than[BR]
in there. Unbelievable![WAIT][END]

19-143
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The architecture of this place[BR]
is really bizarre.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We pass back and forth through[BR]
these glass walls...[BR]
Not knowing what's a mirror and[BR]
what's not really bugs me.[WAIT][END]

19-144
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}An indoor bridge? Now I've seen[BR]
everything![WAIT][END]

19-145
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The official line on this palace[BR]
is that it's temporarily closed[BR]
because of the snow and ice.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think Kolorado would[BR]
research this place?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder if he's already planning[BR]
a trip here...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Maybe he's never heard of the[BR]
palace at all.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Or maybe he just has no clue how[BR]
to get up here.[WAIT][END]

19-146
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's easy to believe that this[BR]
place was originally built as[BR]
a palace to honor the Stars of[BR]
the sky.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Merle said that, didn't he?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's terrible that people have[BR]
forgotten it and don't come[BR]
here anymore. What a waste.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe after we clear it, the[BR]
tourist trade will start anew.[WAIT][END]

19-147
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}That's one big stone statue.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Even you couldn't budge a[BR]
statue that massive, Mario. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If it were just a bit smaller,[BR]
we could probably push it.[WAIT][END]

19-148
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's a mysterious stone[BR]
statue.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This palace seems to have[BR]
cornered the market on[BR]
mysterious stone statues, huh?[WAIT][END]

19-149
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The blue decorating scheme[BR]
makes this place feel so cold.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Some warm tones would help.[BR]
[PAUSE:08]{StartFX:Jitter}{StartFX:FadedNoise:1E}...So...very...cold...[WAIT][END]

19-14A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I think my body temperature has[BR]
dropped about ten degrees since[BR]
we've been here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I should've kept that scarf we[BR]
gave to the snowman.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, you don't look cold.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Is it just because I'm a Goomba[BR]
or because you're a fine-tuned[BR]
adventuring machine?[WAIT][END]

19-14B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hey, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You can reach far-off objects[BR]
by jumping and kicking Kooper's[BR]
shell, isn't that right?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So he can activate switches that[BR]
are across wide gaps or even in[BR]
reflections, right?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wish I could do that, too.[WAIT][END]

19-14C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Those Albino Dinos...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They seem to turn and face us[BR]
when we talk to 'em.[WAIT][END]

19-14D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Hmm...a back door.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]You think it's going to be a[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, by the way...[BR]
What do you think the Star[BR]
Spirits are up to right now?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was just thinking of 'em.[WAIT][END]

19-14E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I thought you already knew that[BR]
you could activate switches by[BR]
giving them some sort of shock.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can use Kooper or Bombette[BR]
to do it, you know.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't forget![WAIT][END]

19-14F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Well, I've determined that[BR]
there's nothing here but cold,[BR]
and {StartFX:Shrinking}I don't like it at all!!![WAIT][END]

19-150
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}All the rooms look alike around[BR]
here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did they design this area to[BR]
intentionally confuse us?[WAIT][END]

19-151
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I wonder how far we've gone.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I really can't say enough[BR]
good things about the star[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean it.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's such a pity that people[BR]

[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}{StartFX:Jitter}{StartFX:FadedNoise:1E}Brrr...[BR]
{EndFX:FadedNoise:FF}G[NOTE]It's so cold. This cold is gonna[BR]
give me a cold...[WAIT][END]

19-153
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I never trust polished floors[BR]
because they're often slippery.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I really don't want to fall and[BR]
bump my head.[WAIT][END]

19-154
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}My reflection is weird.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Seeing myself in the floor is[BR]
starting to freak me out.[WAIT][END]

19-155
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It looks like we can take a[BR]
break here, doesn't it?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If only we had some hot cocoa,[BR]
we could take a real rest.[WAIT][END]

19-156
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's Bowser's Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This appears to be the hangar[BR]
for Bowser's vehicles.[WAIT][END]

19-157
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Boy! Bowser's Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Talk about your basic eerie[BR]
atmosphere, huh? [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{StartFX:Jitter}{StartFX:FadedNoise:1E}Oh... {EndFX:Jitter}{EndFX:FadedNoise:F2}*I'm nervous and excited at[BR]
the same time.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]We're heading for the final fight[BR]
at last![WAIT][END]

19-158
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Are we still outside the castle[BR]
or what?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's hurry through here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]OK, Mario?[WAIT][END]

19-159
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I've gotta hand it to him.[BR]
Bowser's Castle is amazing![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Such creative use of lava flows![BR]
It's just like that volcano![WAIT][END]

19-15A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a covered hallway in[BR]
Bowser's Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It doesn't look like anything's[BR]
amiss in here.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Let's press on, Mario.[WAIT][END]

19-15B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}These stairs aren't lighted[BR]
very well, are they?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I wonder how deep below ground[BR]
they go.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser should really look into[BR]
some ambient lighting.  [WAIT][END]

19-15C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a prison cell where[BR]
Toads are being held.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know... There are Toads[BR]
here...and beds...[BR]
It's kind of like a Toad House![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think that I'm just an[BR]
incurable optimist? Well, what's[BR]
wrong with that?[WAIT][END]

19-15D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a covered hallway.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I can sum up the decorations in[BR]
two words: pure Bowser![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Such dark colors and drab[BR]
lighting! What terrible taste![WAIT][END]

19-15E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at the size of that stone[BR]
Bowser face![BR]
[PAUSE:05]He's pretty scary looking.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That face gives me the creeps,[BR]
Mario.[WAIT][END]

19-15F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's an underground prison cell,[BR]
Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Are you sure you can find the[BR]
way back to where we were[BR]
before?[WAIT][END]

19-160
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I wonder where all this lava[BR]
comes from?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Don't you think it's odd?[WAIT][END]

19-161
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The lava seems to have hardened[BR]
as it cooled off.[WAIT][END]

19-162
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Lava, lava, lava!  There's such[BR]
a thing as too much lava,[BR]
that's for sure.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, are you all right in this[BR]
heat?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Boy, it's hot![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This adventure has just been[BR]
one extreme or the other.[WAIT][END]

19-163
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, walking on newly[BR]
hardened lava is not exactly[BR]
something that your average[BR]
Goomba gets to experience.[WAIT][END]

19-164
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}The only way to cross the lava  [BR]
is to have somebody carry us.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If we could find a way to cool[BR]
the lava off, we could probably[BR]
walk on it, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And if we have to pass through[BR]
lava flows, we can have Bow hide[BR]
us from danger.[WAIT][END]

19-165
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Now we're cooking! I mean, now[BR]
we're not cooking![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's still hot, but not, you know,[BR]
burning hot.[WAIT][END]

19-166
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}There's a treasure chest.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Things are looking up. The lava[BR]
has even cooled. [WAIT][END]

19-167
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Here's the source of the lava.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's miserably hot when it's[BR]
flowing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's not so bad when it's cooled[BR]
off, though.[WAIT][END]

19-168
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It seems to be a cave.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Are we below the castle?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's so dark.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They must have had problems[BR]
setting up lights down here.[BR]
What a pain for us.[WAIT][END]

19-169
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It seems to be a cave.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Are we below the castle?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's so dark.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How long can this darkness[BR]
possibly last? [WAIT][END]

19-16A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Ah! We're back inside Bowser's[BR]
Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's a stone pedestal with[BR]
Bowser's face carved on it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What poor taste![BR]
[PAUSE:05]What an egomaniac![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If we push that thing, what do[BR]
you think will happen?[WAIT][END]

19-16B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a hall in Bowser's Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder where it leads.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]We have to hurry! And yet, we[BR]
should also be careful.[WAIT][END]

19-16C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Here's the storage room for[BR]
Bowser's Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It looks like one of his subjects[BR]
is selling his stuff. Ha ha![WAIT][END]

19-16D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We're somewhere inside Bowser's[BR]
Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This hall is quite large.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It also looks well fortified.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I wonder if there's anything[BR]
good around here?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]An attack item, maybe?[WAIT][END]

19-16E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I'm sure Bowser's going to be[BR]
surprised.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm sure he'd never believe that[BR]
we could make it this far.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't wait to see the[BR]
expression on his face.[WAIT][END]

19-16F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}If Bombette were about three[BR]
times bigger, we could just blow[BR]
all these walls up.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
It would certainly let us move[BR]
through these areas a lot[BR]
faster.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But that's probably not a good[BR]
idea.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It would be far too dangerous.[WAIT][END]

19-170
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This room is one big ego massage[BR]
for Bowser.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I wish we could crush all these[BR]
statues to dust.[WAIT][END]

19-171
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a covered hallway in[BR]
Bowser's Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:03]There's no place to hide around[BR]
here, that's for sure.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Not that we need one, Mario![BR]
Who'd hide? Not me![WAIT][END]

19-172
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Do you think those windows open[BR]
to outside or to the inner part[BR]
of the castle?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm getting totally turned[BR]
around in here. This castle[BR]
really is huge.[WAIT][END]

19-173
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a room without a window.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It also has a chandelier with no[BR]
lights in it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm getting the feeling that[BR]
Bowser is really going for the[BR]
dark, gothic look in here. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe he hates bright lights.[WAIT][END]

19-174
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}All the torches hanging over[BR]
there... Doesn't their pattern[BR]
strike you as sort of[BR]
suspicious?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's almost as if there's a[BR]
hidden meaning there.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What do you say we try to[BR]
remember it?[WAIT][END]

19-175
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I think we keep passing through[BR]
the same room.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Do you think, perhaps, that[BR]
somebody's messing with us?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, it's a waste of time to[BR]
just keep running around with[BR]
no clue about what we're doing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's kind of like what happened[BR]
in Forever Forest.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Say...those torches might hold[BR]
a clue for us.[WAIT][END]

19-176
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Again with the Bowser faces![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm sick of looking at his ugly[BR]
mug![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's find the real Bowser and[BR]
show him who's boss![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And then I can meet Princess[BR]
Peach! [WAIT][END]

19-177
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's the outside of Bowser's[BR]
Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Even the outside feels gross[BR]
and ominous.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe he wasn't so bad until he[BR]
moved here. Living in a such a[BR]
dank place isn't good for the[BR]
soul.[WAIT][END]

19-178
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}How many halls have we been[BR]
through?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I wonder what this one leads[BR]
to...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To Bowser's room? [PAUSE:0A]Maybe?[WAIT][END]

19-179
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Know what this reminds me of?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]A ghost story! This would make[BR]
the perfect setting for a[BR]
freaky ghost story![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We could have Bow and her[BR]
friends play the scary parts.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Remind me to do that some time[BR]
back at Toad Town![WAIT][END]

19-17A
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}It's a prison cell within Bowser's[BR]
Castle.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]A lot of Toads are here.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a bit strange...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Why would Bowser ever need this[BR]
many prison cells?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think there are that many[BR]
prisoners?[WAIT][END]

19-17B
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}I think we've already come[BR]
really far. [BR]
[PAUSE:05]But we're not at Bowser's[BR]
room yet. [PAUSE:05]Where could it be?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This place is so complicated![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That Bowser...[BR]
{StartFX:Shrinking}I really don't like him![WAIT][END]

19-17C
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}{StartFX:Shrinking}"I smell treasure!"[BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}Isn't that a good Kolorado[BR]
imitation? Mario? Wasn't that[BR]
right on?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder what Kolorado's doing?[WAIT][END]

19-17D
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a corridor of sorts. I[BR]
guess it's more like an elevated[BR]
skyway, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If a guy were afraid of heights,[BR]
his legs would probably tremble[BR]
and he'd probably freak out.[BR]
Gulp![WAIT][END]

19-17E
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}You know, if I were designing[BR]
a castle, I wouldn't put in so[BR]
many corridors.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, whatever. You can't expect[BR]
Bowser to have good taste.[WAIT][END]

19-17F
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Look at all these carvings of[BR]
Bowser's ugly mug! It's really[BR]
shameless![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I guess he thinks he's cool.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, incidentally, about those[BR]
stone pedestals...[BR]
Some move and some don't, so[BR]
check 'em all out.[WAIT][END]

19-180
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Whoa! This corridor has much[BR]
lower ceilings, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I guess I had gotten used to[BR]
really high ceilings.[WAIT][END]

19-181
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}In case you don't know by now,[BR]
some of these Bowser pedestals[BR]
can be pushed and others can't.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In many cases, you can push[BR]
them from either the right[BR]
or left sides.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wonder where I heard that?[WAIT][END]

19-182
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This is a hidden passage.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It's a bit dark, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]That's all right. I can sense[BR]
that something good's in here.[HEART][WAIT][END]

19-183
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Some of these Bowser pedestals[BR]
can be pushed and others can't.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In many cases, you can push[BR]
them from either the right[BR]
or left sides.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If they move, you can be sure[BR]
they're covering a hidden[BR]
passage.[WAIT][END]

19-184
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}See! A hidden passage.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This one doesn't seem to be[BR]
hiding anything interesting.[WAIT][END]

19-185
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}...Nothing.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This room's just a dead end.[BR]
How worthless.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let's go back to the room where[BR]
the pedestals are and check 'em[BR]
out![WAIT][END]

19-186
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}This hidden passage looks[BR]
promising, doesn't it? It[BR]
must lead somewhere...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, I hope we're going the[BR]
right direction. I feel kind of[BR]
disoriented.[WAIT][END]

19-187
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}We've certainly seen many kinds[BR]
of treasure on our adventures,[BR]
haven't we, Mario?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's one that I would value[BR]
above all others, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I would keep it in the safest[BR]
place I know...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Mario, please give me your[BR]
autograph!![WAIT][END]

19-188
[STYLE:TATTLE]{Func_2B}Stairs again![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Do you think Princess Peach's [BR]
Castle is at the top of 'em?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We're almost there, Mario! I can[BR]
feel it! Onward! The princess[BR]
awaits![WAIT][END]
