[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}{StartFX:Faded:D9}The other day,[BR]

Bowser and his followers invaded[BR]

0A-003
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}{StartFX:Faded:D9}The Star Rod...[BR]

Bowser has been making wishes[BR]
like, for instance...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
"I'd like to trounce Mario" or[BR]
"I want Princess Peach to like[BR]
me."[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, Stars ignore such[BR]

never granted.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}{StartFX:Faded:D9}Bowser...that fiend...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When he found out that we were[BR]
ignoring his wishes, he came and[BR]
stole the Star Rod so he could[BR]
grant his own wishes.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He seems content right now,[BR]
mainly because he defeated you[BR]
and captured the princess.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Soon enough, though, I fear he[BR]
will wish for more...and then[BR]
terrible things will happen.[WAIT][END]

My sisters and I are totally bad[BR]
about writing back, though.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe I oughta write him a little[BR]
more often, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F][WAIT][NEXT]
This is [PAUSE:0F]a treasure that I've[BR]
kept for a long time. I'm gonna[BR]
give it to you as thanks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You could always come back and[BR]
swap me something for it...[WAIT][END]

0A-05C
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}{StartFX:Faded:D9}Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]can you hear me...?[WAIT][END]

0A-05D
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}{StartFX:Faded:D9}I'm going to open the entrance[BR]
to Star Way.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Enter this path without fear.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The Star Way continues all the[BR]
way up here to Star Haven.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We 7 Star Spirits will be waiting[BR]
for you here. We wish to give you[BR]
our remaining Power.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
With this Power, you will be able[BR]
to stand up to the Star Rod[BR]
Bowser holds.[WAIT][END]

0A-05E
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}{StartFX:Faded:D9}We anxiously await you...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]make haste to Star Haven![WAIT][END]

0A-05F
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Good afternoon,[BR]
... or good evening, maybe?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
In Star Haven you can see[BR]
stars all the time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There used to be a lot more[BR]
shooting stars...but that was[BR]
before the Star Rod was taken.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The beauty of this place was[BR]
incredible back then...[WAIT][END]

0A-060
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}When I first heard that all the[BR]
Star Spirits were captured and[BR]
the Star Rod was stolen,[BR]
I lost it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I figured, this is it![BR]
This is the end of the world![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But now, all of the Star Spirits[BR]
have safely returned.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It just goes to show you never[BR]
give up hope.[WAIT][END]

0A-061
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}When the news first hit that[BR]
the Star Spirits had been taken[BR]
away, a friend of mine was so[BR]
shocked that he got sick.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
His shining light faded way down[BR]
to a mere flicker.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since the Star Spirits have[BR]
come back, he's regaining a[BR]
healthy glow.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You're a lightsaver, Mario![WAIT][END]

0A-062
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Our precious Star Spirits have [BR]
returned! Oh, happy day![BR]
It's all because of you![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess we'll all "wish upon a[BR]
Mario" from now on![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Every Star owes you, Mario![WAIT][END]

0A-063
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}It gives me great joy to hear[BR]
of the Star Spirits' return.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Our only wish now is for the[BR]
return of the Star Rod.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems so odd...a Star making[BR]
a wish![WAIT][END]

0A-064
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Hello![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Need a little rest?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

0A-065
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}...Are you sure?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You seem pretty healthy to me.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Even so, would you care to stay[BR]
over anyway?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

0A-066
{SpeechSound:02}[NEXT]
See you again soon![WAIT][END]

0A-067
{SpeechSound:02}[NEXT]
Please relax.[WAIT][END]

0A-068
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Did you sleep well?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Take care! Bye![WAIT][END]

0A-069
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]you finally made it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The time has come to take the[BR]
fight to Bowser's turf.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hold still while we 7 join[BR]
together to bestow upon you[BR]
our final Power.[WAIT][END]

0A-06A
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}If you use this Power, you can[BR]
drain the power of the Star Rod[BR]
whenever Bowser uses it.[BR]
[PAUSE:05][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]Ah yes! And one more thing,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I have one final gift which[BR]
should come in handy.[WAIT][END]

0A-06B
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}This is the legendary Star Ship[BR]
of Star Haven.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Bowser is keeping his castle[BR]
way up in the sky.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
With this ship, however,[BR]
you can reach it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Climb aboard![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]On to Bowser's Castle![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We will always be with you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Whenever you are in need,[BR]
use our Powers to help you.[WAIT][END]

0A-06C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Look... [PAUSE:0A]...a shooting star![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Princess... come back...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Princess... come back...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Princess... come back...[WAIT][END]

0A-06D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Did you wish for something?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I hope your dreams come true.[WAIT][END]

0A-06E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Me too![HEART][WAIT][END]

0A-06F
[STYLE:RIGHT]I want to see the princess...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I want to see the princess...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I want to see the princess...[WAIT][END]

0A-070
[STYLE:RIGHT]I want to eat Shroom Cake...[BR]
[PAUSE:08]I want to eat Shroom Cake...[BR]
[PAUSE:08]I want to eat tons and tons of[BR]
Shroom Cake... [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, shooting star...[BR]
Please fulfill my wishes...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Pretty please...[WAIT][END]
