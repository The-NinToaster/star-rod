It must have been difficult.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We won't forget your efforts.[WAIT][END]

01-005
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}I hope Bowser learned something[BR]
from all this. Maybe he'll behave[BR]

Although I'd say the chances of[BR]
that are pretty slim.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Tsk tsk... Ah well...[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]... Ohhh. So that's it, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That's how you took the Star[BR]
Rod back from Bowser. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It seems like another wild[BR]
adventure's in the books, bro.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The castle's back in its normal[BR]

home safely...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You came through in the end,[BR]
just like you always do![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
... I know you've been back for[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh! Oh, wow![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This is an invitation to a huge[BR]

It's directly from the princess[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, there's no way I can miss a[BR]
bash this big! [PAUSE:0A]But...[BR]

I should stay here and...[WAIT][END]

01-01D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, poppycock! Balderdash![BR]
Don't be daft, dear boy![BR]

Turning down such an invitation[BR]
would be terribly impolite.[BR]
This is a golden opportunity![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Go to the party this instant![BR]
Don't spare me another thought![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It would ruin the party if the[BR]

01-01E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Huh...[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, bro, guess what?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Parakarry stopped by to drop[BR]
off a party invitation from[BR]
Princess Peach.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He said that he's also invited to[BR]
the party, so he took off and[BR]
said he'd see us at the castle[BR]

your masterful battle...[BR]

Lee and Chan want to take a[BR]
day off from their training to[BR]
go to the party...[BR]
[PAUSE:1E]{StartFX:Shrinking}Truly[PAUSE:05] an outrageous notion!![BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh! Sorry, Mario![BR]

01-02C
[STYLE:RIGHT]I love it when Toad Town is full[BR]

All of Toad Town thanks you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It must have been grueling...[WAIT][END]

01-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well, back to work, I guess...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm not all that excited to get[BR]
back to the grind, but it is[BR]
somehow a relief. [BR]

After all, having a routine is[BR]
probably for the best.[BR]
