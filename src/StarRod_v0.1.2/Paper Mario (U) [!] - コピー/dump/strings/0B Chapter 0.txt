I study self-defense by reading[BR]

They're lifesavers, Mario! Use[BR]

You are no longer a child, and[BR]
evil times are upon us.[BR]

I'm sure Mario will agree...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]You should accompany Mario.[WAIT][END]

You'll have to wait a bit.[BR]

Just relax and don't worry. I'll[BR]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Bleah heh heh heh...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Ah, my instincts were right...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario... I can't believe you're on[BR]
your feet after taking such a[BR]
beating from King Bowser.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You're a hardy one, all right.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was smart to come here to[BR]
check on you.[WAIT][END]

0B-05B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Whuh...what? What's that,[BR]
Daddy!?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What's that weird flying thing?[WAIT][END]

0B-05C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Weird? You rude little...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I am a beautiful Koopa with a[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmmmph!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wish I had time to teach you a[BR]
lesson, brat! But no.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario! Hear this![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It is useless for you to try to[BR]
save Princess Peach. Ridiculous![BR]
Laughable![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
As you have seen, King Bowser is[BR]
more powerful than even you can[BR]
deal with this time.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Here's a gift from him![WAIT][END]

0B-05D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Nyeah heh heh heh![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario! [PAUSE:0A]You will kneel and weep[BR]
when you see the wonderful[BR]

Your world is ours now![WAIT][END]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Kammy Koopa, that fiend![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did you hear what she said about[BR]
the princess?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It didn't sound good. I hope[BR]
nothing's happened to her...[WAIT][END]

0B-060
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Wha... [PAUSE:03]Wha... [PAUSE:03]What!?[BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}[PAUSE:0A]Bowser went and kidnapped [BR]
Princess Peach?! Again?![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, unbelievable! And now you[BR]
have to go to Shooting Star[BR]
Summit and help save her, right?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Ummmm...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This could be a problem.[WAIT][END]

0B-061
[STYLE:RIGHT]Dad, we've just gotta do [BR]
something, right?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario's gotta save the princess![BR]
Nobody else can do it![WAIT][END]

0B-062
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ummmmmmm...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, here's an idea![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe we can break this block[BR]
with Goompa's big Hammer![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think he's using it now to fix[BR]
the veranda.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Go ask him for it, will you?[WAIT][END]

0B-063
[STYLE:RIGHT]I think Goompa is fixing the[BR]
veranda on the house.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm thinking his Hammer might be[BR]
able to break this block.[WAIT][END]

0B-064
[STYLE:RIGHT]Dad![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Did ya hear? I'm going out[BR]
adventuring with Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll make you proud, Dad, I swear[BR]
it! Just wait![WAIT][END]

0B-065
[STYLE:RIGHT]Do your best, son.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You've grown into a strong boy. I[BR]
know you'll be a great help.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a good thing you've spent so[BR]
much time training, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now do your old Goompapa proud![WAIT][END]

0B-066
[STYLE:RIGHT]There we go! Problem solved.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have a feeling your road will be[BR]
lined with difficulties, so try not[BR]
to overdo it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Be watchful, yet stay cool.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]A calm mind is the wisest.[WAIT][END]

0B-067
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, hang on now, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I noticed you aren't wearing the[BR]
Badge Goompa gave you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, that Badge won't do[BR]
anything if you don't wear it.[BR]
[PAUSE:14]I think you'd better put that[BR]
thing on before you go.[WAIT][END]

0B-068
[STYLE:RIGHT]It's simple, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Just keep going straight on this[BR]
road to find Toad Town.[WAIT][END]

0B-069

0B-06B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Howdy, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How's my son Goombario doing?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, by the way, I named the lad[BR]
after you, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I always wanted my son to grow[BR]
up to be strong like you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He went a little overboard... Now[BR]
he's way too energetic![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Ha, ha, ha, ha![WAIT][END]

0B-06C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goombario, [PAUSE:0A]how goes it, son?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't wait to hear about all[BR]
the remarkable things you're out[BR]
doing.[WAIT][END]

0B-06D
[STYLE:RIGHT]It must be pretty gloomy around[BR]
the castle, huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:14]I'm sure the people there are[BR]
depending on you, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The only way to help them is to[BR]
beat Bowser and save Princess[BR]
Peach. Please hurry![WAIT][END]

0B-06E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goombario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]do your best to help Mario, OK?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll make a wish to the Stars for[BR]
you to have good luck.[WAIT][END]

0B-06F
[STYLE:RIGHT]You're Goompapa, correct?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The name's Parakarry. I deliver[BR]
letters.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I believe I have one for you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hang on a moment.[WAIT][END]

0B-070
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...no! Confound it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I seem to have lost it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]...I'm terribly sorry.[WAIT][END]

0B-071
[STYLE:RIGHT]Another letter, duly delivered.[BR]
A postman's job is never done.[WAIT][END]

0B-072
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, thanks. Much obliged, Mr.[BR]
Postal Worker![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]...Oh, great news! [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Fishing is one of my hobbies, and[BR]
this is from a friend who's[BR]
planning a fishing trip. [BR]
[PAUSE:05]I can't wait... [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...Oh...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Sorry to pile work on you, but[BR]
could I give you a letter?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If it's at all possible for you,[BR]
could you deliver this to a Toad[BR]
named Muss T.? He hangs around[BR]
the castle garden.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'd really appreciate it.[WAIT][END]

0B-073
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mr. Goompapa! Parakarry here.[BR]

0B-075
[STYLE:RIGHT]Another letter, duly delivered.[BR]
A postman's job is never done.[WAIT][END]

0B-076
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thank you, sir. What would we do[BR]
without postal service?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, how interesting... A letter[BR]
for Goombaria.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]I guess I could open it...[BR]
[PAUSE:14][WAIT][NEXT]
I remember she wrote a letter[BR]
just the other day and I was[BR]
wondering what it was.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I see. I guess it was a question.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And this seems like the answer.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]It looks pretty complicated...[BR]
but I think I understand.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll tell her all about it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Thanks so much for the prompt[BR]
delivery.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Here, take this![WAIT][END]

0B-077
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, land sakes! Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]So nice to meet you! My![BR]

tell you how worried I was when[BR]
you were just lying there asleep[BR]
for so long.[WAIT][END]

0B-078
[STYLE:RIGHT]You should know that my son,[BR]
Goombario, is a big fan of yours.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
All he does the livelong day is[BR]
train and tell people how he[BR]
wants to be great like you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I tell him, "Goombario! It's all[BR]
well and good to train, but don't[BR]
you go getting into danger!"[WAIT][END]

0B-079
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goompa...?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I thought he was fixing the[BR]
veranda.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]He most likely had the Hammer[BR]
you're looking for, too.[WAIT][END]

0B-07A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mom![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I get to go with Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I promise when I come back, I'll[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Now you listen![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You be a good boy, you hear![BR]
Don't cause Mario any trouble![WAIT][END]

0B-07C
[STYLE:RIGHT]I know, Mom, sheesh. I'll be good.[WAIT][END]

0B-07D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goombario, you mind your mom![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Wear a sweater when it's cold![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't be picky about your food![BR]
Don't start fights! Be polite![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Don't boast about all the things[BR]
Goompa taught you[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]as if you already knew them!![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And remember... And...[WAIT][END]

0B-07E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Urgh...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Mom always nags me...[WAIT][END]

0B-07F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now hush! Mario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]please take good care of my[BR]
sweet little Goombario.[WAIT][END]

0B-080
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, please take good care of[BR]
my sweet little Goombario.[WAIT][END]

0B-081
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, land sakes! Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:14]Is my Goombario bothering you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He can be a real handful,[BR]
sometimes, so I worry...[WAIT][END]

0B-082
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ugh...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Mom! C'mon, cut it out![WAIT][END]

0B-083
[STYLE:RIGHT]I heard that Toad Town has[BR]
finally calmed down a bit.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Finally! It's been ages since I[BR]
went shopping in peace![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We owe it all to you, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:14]...Or maybe, possibly, my dear[BR]
son Goombario helped? A little,[BR]
perhaps?[WAIT][END]

0B-084
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goombario, c'mere.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm sure you're working hard.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Let me just get that gunk off[BR]
your face. Hold still.[WAIT][END]

0B-085
[STYLE:RIGHT]C'mon, Mom, quit it![WAIT][END]

0B-086
[STYLE:RIGHT]I do love to shop, but the[BR]
problem with Toad Town is that[BR]
there are just too many things.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Still, it's nice to be in a busy[BR]
area now and then.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think the next time I shop, I'll[BR]
bring Goombaria.[WAIT][END]

0B-087
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goombario, [PAUSE:0A]good luck, sweetie![WAIT][END]

0B-088
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, you look better.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm so glad...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was really worried about you,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]because you were lying there in[BR]
the forest and you didn't open[BR]
your eyes at all the whole time.[WAIT][END]

0B-089
[STYLE:RIGHT]I was the one who found you,[BR]
you know, Mario. Me! Goombaria![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was in the forest and I found[BR]
you and then I called Daddy and[BR]
Goompa and Goombario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And then they came and got you[BR]
and I'm glad you're better![WAIT][END]

And then they came and got you[BR]
and I'm glad you're better![WAIT][END]

0B-08B
[STYLE:RIGHT]I wanted to go with you, too, you[BR]
know, but Daddy told me it was[BR]
too dangerous, so I have to stay[BR]
here instead. Hmmph.[WAIT][END]

0B-08C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goompa! Come out here! Mario's[BR]
in trouble![WAIT][END]

0B-08D
[STYLE:RIGHT]It's not fair! Goombario always[BR]
gets to do all the fun stuff![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Mario, when I grow up, can I go[BR]
on an adventure, too?[WAIT][END]

0B-08E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario! Have you been beating up[BR]
lots and lots of bad guys?[WAIT][END]

0B-08F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario! I wanna go with you like[BR]
Goombario gets to![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You go to all kinds of pretty[BR]
towns and places, don't you?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wanna go, too! I wanna go![BR]
Why can't I go, too?[WAIT][END]

0B-090
[STYLE:RIGHT]You're just a little too young[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]You wouldn't believe how hard life[BR]
is out on the road.[WAIT][END]

0B-091
[STYLE:RIGHT]Shut up, Goombario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Stop smiling! I wanna go, too![WAIT][END]

0B-092
[STYLE:RIGHT]Everyone in the world is counting[BR]
on you, huh, Mario?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How do you deal with the[BR]
pressure all the time?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, if it helps at all, you can[BR]
depend on me, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:02]I'll grow up extra fast so I can[BR]
help you out! [WAIT][END]

0B-093
[STYLE:RIGHT]Goombario,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]do you actually do anything?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I never hear about anything you[BR]
do. Only Mario.[WAIT][END]

0B-094
[STYLE:RIGHT]Of course you don't hear!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]My role is to assist Mario, not to[BR]
be the hero.[WAIT][END]

0B-095
[STYLE:RIGHT]Huh...?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Really...? You fibber...[WAIT][END]

0B-096

Have you already met my lovely[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Goombario...[BR]

at home for a while?[WAIT][END]

0B-0A6
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, my back... [PAUSE:05]Hm? Who's that?[BR]
That you, Mario?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I remember a great crashing[BR]
noise and then the veranda[BR]
collapsed and I fell.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Did you fall, too?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Just stepped out the door into[BR]
thin air, did you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, we're both OK. Problem is,[BR]
we can't get home because that[BR]
block is in the way.[WAIT][END]

0B-0A7
[STYLE:RIGHT]This block...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]This block shouldn't be here.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Well, this is a problem for us.[WAIT][END]

0B-0A8
[STYLE:RIGHT]......Huh?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]A Hammer? Oh, of course![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Um... [PAUSE:0A]Where did it go?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was using it to fix the[BR]
veranda, so it's likely around[BR]
here somewhere...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hm! Nowhere to be seen.[BR]
[PAUSE:14]I guess it must have fallen[BR]
somewhere over there.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, [PAUSE:0A]we'd better look for it.[WAIT][END]

0B-0A9
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Hammer has got to be[BR]
somewhere close by.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{StartAnim}{SetPrintPos:00:12}{Down:0C}{Item:00:04}{EndAnim}[BR]
{SetPrintPos:00:3F}{Down:06}It looks just like this.[BR]
[BR]
{Up:06}[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Look for bushes that might cover[BR]
it up.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If "{Color:20}!{Color:0A}" appears over your head,[BR]
you can press {PushColor}{Color:10}[A]{PopColor} to search. [WAIT][END]

0B-0AA
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh!! There we go![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That's it! That's the Hammer![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll wager that if you use that[BR]
Hammer, you can break the block[BR]
that's in our way.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can also use the Hammer to[BR]
hit trees and make them sway.[BR]
Sometimes stuff will fall out![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can use it by pressing {PushColor}{Color:11}[B]{PopColor}.[WAIT][END]

0B-0AB
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh! Well now![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I believe that's the dolly that[BR]
Goombaria said she lost![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She'll no doubt be overjoyed if[BR]
you give it back to her.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So many people lose things all[BR]
over the place, you know.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It almost makes one feel like[BR]
looking around everywhere...[WAIT][END]

0B-0AC
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hmmm... Well![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We found the Hammer, so I guess[BR]
we should head for home.[WAIT][END]

[PAUSE:0A]this is Jr. Troopa. He's the boss[BR]

He's more bark than bite. You[BR]

Just boost yourself up and don't[BR]

got {Color:20}Star Points{Color:0A}![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You get Star Points every time[BR]
you beat an enemy.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Every time you save up 100 Star[BR]
Points, you'll go up a level.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Always try hard to get points![WAIT][END]

0B-0B5
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Shoooooot!![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I was winning, too! [BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'll be back, Mario![WAIT][END]

0B-0B6
[STYLE:RIGHT]I mean it, I'll be back!![WAIT][END]

0B-0B7
[STYLE:RIGHT]Heads up, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I see bad Goombas ahead.[BR]
They're loyal to Bowser.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If they see you, they'll attack[BR]
you without hesitation.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you can successfully attack[BR]
an enemy in the field with a[BR]
{Color:20}Jump {Color:0A}or {Color:20}Hammer{Color:0A},[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
you'll get the {Color:20}First Strike {Color:0A}when[BR]
you enter the battle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Striking first really helps when[BR]
it comes to battling.[WAIT][END]

0B-0B8
[STYLE:RIGHT]Listen up, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The enemy's flying. [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Your Hammer won't reach[BR]
enemies in the air.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To attack airborne enemies, use[BR]
a Jump attack. [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You can jump over one enemy to[BR]
attack one behind it, too.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This is good advice. Remember it![WAIT][END]

0B-0B9
[STYLE:RIGHT]This is a Spiked Goomba.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]See the spike on his head?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Be careful not to jump on him.[BR]
You'll definitely get hurt.[WAIT][END]

0B-0BA
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey Mario,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
during a battle, you can change[BR]
the order we attack in with {PushColor}{Color:14}[Z]{PopColor}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can attack first if you want.[BR]
I don't mind at all![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Just keep it in mind, OK?[WAIT][END]

0B-0BB
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey hey! Hold it right there![BR]
[PAUSE:14]You! Yeah you, suspicious guy![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't move![WAIT][END]

0B-0BC
[STYLE:RIGHT]Aha, you're Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:14]I knew it. You can't go past[BR]
here, Mr. Big Shot.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's a direct order from the[BR]
Goomba King. That's right![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sorry, but the only way by[BR]
[PAUSE:05]is through the Goomba Bros.[BR]
That's me, Red Goomba, and my[BR]
brother, Blue Goomba.[WAIT][END]

0B-0BD
[STYLE:RIGHT]Let's get him, Blue Goomba![WAIT][END]

0B-0BE
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh yeah! [PAUSE:05]Let's do it, my red[BR]

0B-0C3
[STYLE:RIGHT]King Goomba! Help us![WAIT][END]

0B-0C4
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario beat us up![WAIT][END]

0B-0C5
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, look, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]See that building over there?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm pretty sure there used to[BR]
be a bridge on the other side.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wonder what happened to it.[WAIT][END]

0B-0C6
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Jitter}{StartFX:Shrinking}So, Mario, it's true! You've made[BR]
it this far. [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I respect you for that.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Unfortunately, this is as far as[BR]
you'll ever get.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Because I, the great and[BR]
powerful King Goomba, will see to[BR]
it that you advance no farther![WAIT][END]

0B-0C7
[STYLE:RIGHT]You hear that, Mario! No[BR]
farther! Not one step![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Are you scared, little man?[WAIT][END]

0B-0C8
[STYLE:RIGHT]Bah ha ha!!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Yeah, you're scared, all right.[BR]
You wanna say you're sorry?[WAIT][END]

0B-0C9
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wow... That King Goomba is...[BR]
really huge![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure he's no match for you,[BR]
though, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:14]Let's get him![WAIT][END]

0B-0CA
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Jitter}{StartFX:Shrinking}Ready to meet my wrath, Mario?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You'd better be!![WAIT][END]

0B-0CB
[STYLE:RIGHT]Beat him up, King Goomba!![WAIT][END]

0B-0CC
[STYLE:RIGHT]We've got your back![WAIT][END]

0B-0CD
[STYLE:RIGHT]Leave him to me![WAIT][END]

0B-0CE
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I think maybe we ought to take[BR]
out the Goomba Bros. first, don't[BR]
you think?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They must be pretty weak since[BR]
we just finished beating them up[BR]
back there.[WAIT][END]

0B-0CF
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh no! It can't be! King[BR]
Goomba!![WAIT][END]

King Goomba![WAIT][END]

[PAUSE:0A]How could I lose?[WAIT][END]

0B-0D2
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yeah! I knew we could do it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Cooool!! Victory!![WAIT][END]

0B-0D3
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}Red Goomba,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]you're positive that you hid the[BR]
switch well, right?[WAIT][END]

0B-0D4
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}Of course, King Goomba![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I hid it in the grass outside the[BR]
fortress. [WAIT][END]

0B-0D5
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}{StartFX:Shrinking}{StartFX:Jitter}Outside the... You idiot![BR]
{EndFX:Jitter}{EndFX:Shrinking}You didn't hide it in here? Mario[BR]
will find it for sure![WAIT][END]

0B-0D6
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}{StartFX:Shrinking}Oh! Do you think?[BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}[PAUSE:0A]You know...you might be right.[WAIT][END]

0B-0D7
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Faded:D9}King Goomba,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]maybe we ought to try to trick[BR]
Mario before he tries to...[WAIT][END]

0B-0D8
[STYLE:RIGHT]Uh...Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Good fight and all that! I must[BR]
warn you, however...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you happen to find a strange[BR]
switch somewhere, you should[BR]
definitely not press it.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's dangerous. Understand?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
.[PAUSE:05].[PAUSE:05].[PAUSE:05]...you what?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]{StartFX:Shrinking}{StartFX:Jitter}You already pressed it?![WAIT][END]

our journey. All right![WAIT][END]

is doing right now...[WAIT][END]

0B-0DC
[STYLE:RIGHT]{Speed:01:02}Whoa! Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0F]It's you! Good to see you![WAIT][END]

0B-0DD
[STYLE:RIGHT]And you're all right![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]After all that castle craziness,[BR]
I was really worried about you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I ran outside just as the[BR]
earthquake started, so I[BR]
managed to escape in time.[WAIT][END]

0B-0DE

[STYLE:RIGHT]I see. Great, just great.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You're on an exciting adventure[BR]
with Mario. Talk about unfair.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
See, someone has to look after[BR]
this house, so I can't leave. Oh[BR]
well. Take care of Mario, OK?[WAIT][END]

0B-0E4
[STYLE:RIGHT]Somebody sure has to save the[BR]
poor princess. Good luck![WAIT][END]

0B-0E5
[STYLE:RIGHT]Good luck, Mario. You just have[BR]
to save that princess![WAIT][END]

0B-0E6
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, I'll go to any lengths to[BR]
help you out.[BR]

I have lots of talents, and I can[BR]
jump really high and...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What? Stay home and take care[BR]
of the house?[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Man, that's not exciting at all![WAIT][END]

brothers who're Koopa Troopas?[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Why don't we give them a taste[BR]
of our Mario Bros. power![BR]

get really upset and yell.[WAIT][END]

0B-0EF
[STYLE:RIGHT]Huff [PAUSE:05]Huff...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]I'm a great jumper, but my[BR]
running really needs some work.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A little more training and I'll be[BR]
vital to your team...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
All right, take it easy. I know I[BR]
can't go.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You go on your adventure. I[BR]
don't even want to anymore.[BR]

I know that it's up to you to[BR]
