they gave me a souvenir![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It was a Goomnut, a special[BR]
treat from Goomba Village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It looked so yummy I ate it[BR]
without telling my brother![BR]
My FP increased by 3.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
.........You think he'll notice?[WAIT][END]

20-055
[STYLE:INSPECT]I heard that my brother went[BR]
to Lavalava Island on a tuna.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Unbelievable! So unfair!![BR]
I... I... I wanna ride on[BR]
a tuna, too![WAIT][END]

20-056
[STYLE:INSPECT]I heard that some Yoshi kids on[BR]
Lavalava Island got lost and[BR]
my brother saved them.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I bet Yoshi kids are just about[BR]
the cutest things around.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm a bit jealous of my brother.[WAIT][END]

20-057
[STYLE:INSPECT]I heard a rumor that I actually[BR]
have lots of fans. Wow![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What great news! To live up to[BR]
their expectations, I want to[BR]
play the lead in an adventure![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, my name would have [BR]
to be in the title.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That'd be sweet...[HEART][BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But I know it'll never happen...[WAIT][END]

20-058
[STYLE:INSPECT]I heard that a door appeared[BR]
in Toad Town. They say it leads[BR]
to Flower Fields.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess lots of Flower Spirits[BR]
live in that flowery place.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Flower Spirits... I bet their[BR]
souls are as beautiful as the[BR]
prettiest flowers...[WAIT][END]

20-059
[STYLE:INSPECT]Somebody said to me that a[BR]
way will open when you use[BR]
a scarf and bucket... What?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
A scarf for a snowman?[BR]
Wouldn't it melt him?[WAIT][END]

20-05A
[STYLE:INSPECT]Yesterday, I got stuck in[BR]
the trapdoor when I was [BR]
entering my secret room...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Have I been using it too much?[BR]
Or am I putting on weight?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'd better oil it to make it[BR]
open easier.[WAIT][END]

20-05B
[STYLE:INSPECT]When I looked up at the sky[BR]
tonight, I saw a shooting star[BR]
arcing across the sky toward[BR]
Princess Peach's Castle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I made a wish to the Stars[BR]
right away, but I wonder if[BR]
it will really be granted...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What I wished was.............[BR]
..............................[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't write it even though[BR]
this is a secret diary.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Aargh! You can see it even[BR]
though I erased it![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{Color:17}My wish is to sleep in the top[BR]
bunk bed.[WAIT][END]

20-05C
[STYLE:INSPECT]I heard that my brother finally[BR]
saved Princess Peach![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser increased his power with[BR]
the Star Rod, but my brilliant[BR]
brother beat him anyway![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess he'll be coming back home[BR]
pretty soon.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm looking forward to listening[BR]
to the story of his adventure.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Anyway, I'm going to finish this[BR]
diary for now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have to seal this room off[BR]
before he notices that I[BR]
remodeled without telling him.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now I'm going to go prepare a[BR]
dinner to celebrate Mario's[BR]
return! [BR]
                         Luigi[WAIT][END]
