He's heading for Toad Town now.[WAIT][END]

14-001
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}What? Unbelievable![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What was Goomba King thinking?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I used the Star Rod to make him[BR]
a king because he begged me...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And Mario whips him so easily?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What a wimp!![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Uh...Kammy Koopa![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You ARE sure that Mario can[BR]
never defeat us, right?[WAIT][END]

14-002
[STYLE:RIGHT]Please, please, Your Vileness![BR]
Try to be calm.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Goomba King is small-time.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I had a feeling he'd fail.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It doesn't matter, because[BR]
while you hold the Star Rod[BR]
you are definitely invincible.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You could beat Mario with one[BR]
claw tied behind your back.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}By the way, Kammy Koopa,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]those Star Spirits we captured[BR]
don't have any way of giving[BR]
Mario their power, do they?[WAIT][END]

14-005
[STYLE:RIGHT]Please, don't worry yourself.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Each is held separately.[BR]

Who's the closest Star Spirit to[BR]
Mario? It's that one at[BR]

the job done?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That Goomba King was gigantic,[BR]
and even he couldn't beat Mario.[WAIT][END]

14-00B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Pssshaw! Get real, [PAUSE:05]King Bowser![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Yeah, the Goomba King was huge,[BR]
but he was a total wimpola![BR]
We're nothing like him![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
See, what we've got going on is[BR]
the power of teamwork...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Together, we can put the hurt[BR]

We're soooooo high above the sky[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Even Mario doesn't have a[BR]

[STYLE:CENTER]{SpeechSound:01}You know, Princess, as long as I[BR]

Oh, how delightful![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They deserve it for the way[BR]
they've treated us Koopas over[BR]

14-01E
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}If you, you know, want anything,[BR]
all you need to do is ask me,[BR]
Princess. I can grant wishes.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Of course, I'll only grant[BR]
requests that I like...[BR]

You take care, Princess Peach![BR]

Here's my wish: Go right now and[BR]
take that Star Rod back from[BR]
Bowser, OK?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Think you can do it?[WAIT][END]

14-028
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}......[BR]
[PAUSE:14][WAIT][NEXT]
Uh...sorry...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]That's a little much for a novice[BR]
Star like me...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Maybe one of the honorable Star[BR]
Spirits from Star Haven could[BR]
grant a wish like that.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm so sorry.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Please, ask for something easy,[BR]
something a small Star can do.[WAIT][END]

14-029
[STYLE:RIGHT]Then... [PAUSE:03]Can you take me away[BR]
from here?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Everyone in my castle has been[BR]
captured and I have to save[BR]
them all as soon as possible.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}...Oh...I'm sorry.[BR]
[PAUSE:14]I can't grant that wish either,[BR]
I'm afraid.[BR]

Actually, I just got called up to[BR]
the sky a day ago, so I can't do[BR]
big wishes yet...[BR]

If I were a more splendid Star,[BR]
maybe I could actually help...[WAIT][END]

[PAUSE:14]Do you think you can find Mario?[BR]
{Func_04}[WAIT][NEXT]
I want you to give this to him.[WAIT][END]

Why, I bet he's saving some Star[BR]

14-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yes... You're right, Twink.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I must be strong.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I need to concentrate on finding[BR]
a way out of here.[WAIT][END]

14-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}But there are tons of guards[BR]
just beyond your door...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And it's impossible for you to[BR]
escape through the window...[WAIT][END]

14-037
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh! Wait a minute![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I remember the Minister telling[BR]

Twink![BR]

{Color:00}Day: [CIRCLE]/[CIRCLE]  Month: [STAR] [BR]
Sunny[BR]

Today I went to Star Haven and[BR]
stole the Star Rod.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Now I'm invincible! Cool![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I also captured those seven[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Should we read more?[BR]
{Func_04}[END]

14-04E
[NEXT]
{SpeechSound:02}OK, let's continue.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
{Color:00}Day: [CIRCLE]/[CROSS]  Month: [STAR][BR]
Cloudy then sunny[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Today was great, diary! I used[BR]
my castle to lift Princess[BR]
Peach's Castle way up into the[BR]
sky! [BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Then I barged into Peach's[BR]
Castle and beat up Mario! Yeah![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Unbelievable, I know! So fun![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And there's more! After that, I[BR]

I'm so mad I can barely write![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]"Ohh, I'm Mario, I'm so big and[BR]

I hate him! But I'm not worried.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There's no way Mario can save[BR]
the Star Spirit being held[BR]
in {Color:07}Dry Dry Ruins{Color:00}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
To do that, he'd have to solve[BR]
the mystery of the sands and[BR]
then find Dry Dry Ruins in [BR]
{Color:07}Dry Dry Desert{Color:00}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How would he even know to go to[BR]

[STYLE:CENTER]{Volume:32}...Hey...  [PAUSE:05]Have you heard[BR]
[PAUSE:05]about Master Tubba Blubba?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I heard a rumor that he loves[BR]
eating ghosts![WAIT][END]

14-06F
[STYLE:LEFT]{Volume:32}Ugh... Ghosts, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Master Tubba Blubba... [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He lives deep inside of[BR]
{Color:20}Forever Forest{Color:0A}, doesn't he?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think he's guarding one of the[BR]
Star Spirits right now.[WAIT][END]

14-070
[STYLE:CENTER]{Volume:32}Yeah, Master Tubba Blubba lives[BR]
in the castle at the top[BR]
of {Color:20}Gusty Gulch{Color:0A}.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I heard that somewhere near his[BR]
castle is a mansion and a village[BR]
full of ghosts.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess Master Tubba Blubba [BR]
sometimes goes there to catch[BR]
Boos.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And then, when he catches one,[BR]
he gobbles it down starting with[BR]
its head! Chomp![WAIT][END]

14-071
[STYLE:LEFT]{Volume:32}{StartFX:Jitter}Brrrrr...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, man, that's so scary...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now I won't be able to walk to[BR]
the bathroom alone at night...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]And I'm gonna have nightmares, I[BR]
know it! Why'd you tell me?[WAIT][END]

14-072
[STYLE:CENTER]{Volume:32}I also heard that Master Tubba[BR]
Blubba is invincible.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They say he can't be hurt.[BR]
Nobody can even scratch him![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He might even be stronger than[BR]
King Bowser...[WAIT][END]

14-073
[STYLE:LEFT]{Volume:32}Stronger than King Bowser?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Come on! That's impossible![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Even Master Tubba Blubba has to[BR]
have some weak points. It's just[BR]
common sense![WAIT][END]

14-074
[STYLE:CENTER]{Volume:32}Yeah... You may be right...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
There's another rumor that[BR]
Tubba Blubba's got a secret[BR]
that would ruin him if it ever[BR]
got out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I bet it's about his past. I[BR]
heard he didn't used to be[BR]

He might gobble us up![BR]

...Still...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What do you think his secret[BR]
could be, anyway?[WAIT][END]

14-076
[STYLE:CENTER]{Volume:32}I don't know.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]No one knows. That's why it's a[BR]
secret, you half-wit![WAIT][END]

14-077
[STYLE:RIGHT]{Volume:32}Twink... [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It sounds like Tubba Blubba has[BR]

14-07D

14-07F

14-080
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:02}Well... [PAUSE:05]Um... [PAUSE:05]No use wondering![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Why don't we go out and try to[BR]
eavesdrop again?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If Mario managed to beat Tubba[BR]
Blubba by now,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Bowser and his followers will be[BR]
really, really mad![BR]
[PAUSE:14]...Don't you think?[WAIT][END]

14-081
[STYLE:RIGHT]You may be right, Twink![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There's no use just sitting[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]Let's see what we can find out.[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}{StartFX:Shrinking}It can't be!! No! No! No![BR]

14-083
[STYLE:RIGHT]Your Wretchedness,[BR]

Tubba Blubba was...gulp...[BR]
defeated by Mario.[WAIT][END]

14-084
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}Well, that's strange because...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]YOU TOLD ME HE WAS INVINCIBLE![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How can you beat someone who's[BR]
invincible?[WAIT][END]

14-085
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}Grrrr...  [PAUSE:05]Stupid Mario...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I guess maybe he found out the[BR]
secret that made Tubba Blubba[BR]
not quite so invincible...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And then he beat him...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Gah!!! I despise Mario! Really![WAIT][END]

14-086
[STYLE:RIGHT]Your Filthiness...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]We have to come up with another[BR]
tactic, and quickly.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario will most likely go[BR]
to {Color:20}Shy Guy's Toy Box {Color:0A}next.[WAIT][END]

14-087
[STYLE:RIGHT]{SpeechSound:01}Yes... So we should prepare[BR]
something there for his arrival.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I won't be satisfied just having[BR]
him beaten up anymore![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What we need to do is find his[BR]
weak point and completely[BR]
humiliate him! Yeah![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Kammy Koopa, you've gotta find[BR]
out what Mario hates, and...[BR]

We're just discussing the weak[BR]

So... Princess Peach...[BR]

But, then again, King Bowser's[BR]

[PAUSE:0A]I guess we'll see![WAIT][END]

14-091
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm not sure we can entirely[BR]

about Mario's weak points, but[BR]
I'll do as you say.[WAIT][END]

14-098
