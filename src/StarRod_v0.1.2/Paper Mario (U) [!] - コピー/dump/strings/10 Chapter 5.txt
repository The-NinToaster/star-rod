[STYLE:RIGHT]Well, well. Mario, old boy![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Certainly took your time, eh?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Let's head back together, hm?[WAIT][END]

10-007
[STYLE:RIGHT]What a heady adventure![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Adieu, Lavalava Island![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Perchance someday I shall[BR]

10-009
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wheeze wheeze wheeze...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Yes! I...cough...did it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I swam...all the way![WAIT][END]

10-00A
[STYLE:RIGHT]All right, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Now I'm going to give you a[BR]

Do you have issues with me?[BR]
A bit of jealousy, perhaps?[WAIT][END]

[STYLE:RIGHT]Phew... You saved me![BR]

Well, enough of that![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Let's pull ourselves together[BR]

10-010
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Yaaah! Get off! Aaaaaah!![WAIT][END]

10-011
[STYLE:RIGHT]Dear me! I barely got away...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]That was rather rude, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Leaving me like that! Hmph![BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]Well, we can't all be heroes...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Let's press on, hm?[WAIT][END]

10-012
[STYLE:RIGHT]I swear, all of these natives are[BR]
so panicky that we can't get[BR]
any information![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess someone had better solve[BR]
their problem so we can quiz[BR]
them, eh, old boy?[WAIT][END]

10-013
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, old man,[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]the Village Leader was just[BR]
looking for you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'd say he wants to thank you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Better hurry, hm?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He might just tell you where the[BR]
treasure is if he's feeling[BR]
thankful enough![WAIT][END]

10-014
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well, well...finally.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Everyone's calmed a bit.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now we can get some good[BR]
information about treasure from[BR]
these locals.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well... Where to start...[WAIT][END]

10-015
[STYLE:RIGHT]We simply must go search for[BR]
that treasure at the volcano.[WAIT][END]

10-016
[STYLE:RIGHT]I must get my hands on the[BR]
volcano's treasure![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My keen intuition senses that[BR]
there must be a way![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmmm...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I suppose there's a slim chance[BR]
it was blown clear in the[BR]
eruption...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'd best check around the village[BR]
for some clues.[WAIT][END]

10-017
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hm?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You know, dear boy, I couldn't[BR]
help but notice you holding[BR]
something resembling treasure.[WAIT][END]

10-018
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario! Good heavens![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's the treasure![BR]
[PAUSE:14]How on earth did you...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]...well, I suppose that's of no[BR]
consequence right now. You're[BR]
giving it to me?[WAIT][END]

10-019
[STYLE:RIGHT]You...you are giving it to me?![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, glory! Marvelous!![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Dear man, you are quite simply[BR]
the cat's meow![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Cheers![WAIT][END]

10-01A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yes, hm! I suppose...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's only proper that I give this[BR]
to you as thanks.[WAIT][END]

10-01B
[STYLE:RIGHT]A Bub-ulb gave it to me while[BR]
I was off exploring.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure it's quite a valuable[BR]
seed, but I'm not interested in[BR]
it at all.[WAIT][END]

10-01C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Now that I've got the treasure,[BR]
I proclaim this adventure to be[BR]
a complete success![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What a stupendous expedition![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It will be forever recorded in[BR]
the history of archaeology![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, old boy, let's away![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Back to Toad Town with us![WAIT][END]

10-01D
[STYLE:RIGHT]You're Kolorado, correct?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The name's Parakarry. I deliver[BR]
letters.[BR]

I believe I have one for you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hang on a moment.[WAIT][END]

10-01E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh...no! Confound it![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I seem to have lost it![BR]

10-01F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Another letter, duly delivered.[BR]
A postman's job is never done.[WAIT][END]

10-020
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, good show![BR]
[PAUSE:0F]It's a letter from my wife.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Thank you ever so, old chap.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]This is just what I needed to[BR]
give me the strength to go on.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]...I know![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'll pass this along as a spot of[BR]
thanks.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I came across it while I was[BR]
wandering about the jungle[BR]
researching things.[WAIT][END]

10-021
[STYLE:RIGHT]Welcome to you, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I am the Village Leader of [BR]
Yoshi's Village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]...Ah, you come seeking help.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You wish to go to Mt. Lavalava,[BR]
do you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mmmm...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The entrance to the volcano is[BR]
in the jungle, but it's very[BR]
difficult to get to it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The volcano has awakened, as[BR]
well. I think it may be too[BR]
dangerous for you to go there.[WAIT][END]

10-023
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, I must thank you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You have saved the children of[BR]
the village. I feel that no[BR]
expression of our gratitude[BR]
could be enough.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You truly are a hero.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We deeply appreciate your valor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
At least I can do this...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You still wish to go to Mt.[BR]
Lavalava, don't you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have remembered a good way to[BR]
reach the volcano.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please come this way.[WAIT][END]

10-024
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mario, I must thank you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You have saved the children of[BR]
the village. I feel that no[BR]
expression of our gratitude[BR]
could be enough.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You truly are a hero.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We deeply appreciate your valor.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I have heard from your[BR]
companion, Kolorado, that you[BR]
wish to go to Mt. Lavalava.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since you have blessed our[BR]
village with your kindness, I will[BR]
show you the best way to reach[BR]
the volcano.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please come this way.[WAIT][END]

10-025
[STYLE:RIGHT]Huh[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].? [PAUSE:03]I thought it was[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[PAUSE:03].[BR]
[PAUSE:08]somewhere around here...[WAIT][END]

10-026
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, yes. I found it. Here it is.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Take it, please.[WAIT][END]

10-027
[STYLE:RIGHT]Whenever events beyond our[BR]
control occur on this island, we[BR]
ask the help of Raphael the[BR]
Raven, the island's master.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If anyone can help you reach the[BR]
volcano, it's definitely Raphael[BR]
the Raven. He lives in the depths[BR]
of this island.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you place that Jade Raven[BR]
into the statue of Raphael, the[BR]
way into the depths of the[BR]
jungle will appear.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I haven't been to see Raphael[BR]
since I was but a young Yoshi.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I remember that it was[BR]
incredibly difficult to find him[BR]
because the jungle's trees and[BR]
shrubs covered the way.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sure you'll find the path.[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]May all your wishes come true.[WAIT][END]

10-028
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wait just one minute...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You must have one heck of a[BR]
story behind you, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Why in the world would you want[BR]
to go to Mt. Lavalava?[BR]
[WAIT]{Func_04}[END]

10-029
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wait just one minute...[BR]

10-02A
[NEXT]
Why in the world would you want[BR]
to go to Mt. Lavalava?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sorry, but I can't just keep[BR]
my mouth shut when I hear[BR]
someone talking crazy.[BR]
[WAIT]{Func_04}[END]

10-02B
[NEXT]
It's VERY hot and VERY [BR]
dangerous in the volcano![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you aren't extremely careful[BR]
AND lucky, you'll be roasted to[BR]
a golden brown.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But you don't care. You guys are[BR]
going there anyway![BR]
[PAUSE:05]I do NOT approve of this![WAIT][END]

10-02C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Uh-huh... Oh... Oh![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You're going to the volcano[BR]
because you want to save the[BR]
princess from some bad guys?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What...a touching story![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Romantic stories like that...[BR]
just touch a soft spot in this[BR]
heart of mine.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A][WAIT][NEXT]
[PAUSE:0A]That does it! I can't let you go[BR]
alone! I, Sushie, will be by your[BR]
side until the end![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You needn't worry, Mario! I love[BR]
taking care of others![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you plan on getting through[BR]
this jungle, you need me anyway.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Come, Mario! [PAUSE:0A]That volcano isn't[BR]
getting any cooler! [WAIT][END]

10-02D
[STYLE:RIGHT]If you put that Jade Raven into[BR]
the statue of Raphael, the way[BR]
into the depths of the jungle[BR]
will appear.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Since trees and bushes have[BR]
grown over the path, you might[BR]
get lost.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you do, just be sure to scout[BR]
the area carefully.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You might have to do something[BR]
unexpected to find your way.[WAIT][END]

10-02E
[STYLE:RIGHT]So, Raphael the Raven granted[BR]
you an audience, did he?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm not surprised, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You saved the children... [BR]
You are one of the honored[BR]
members of this island now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The great Raphael probably[BR]
thought so, too.[WAIT][END]

10-02F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Please don't tell Kolorado about[BR]
Raphael the Raven or the way to[BR]
the volcano.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That Koopa's a bit loopy. I[BR]
shudder to think what he'd do.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I must say I worry he'd harm[BR]
himself inside the volcano.[WAIT][END]

10-030
[STYLE:RIGHT]I see you are finally going to[BR]
brave the volcano.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Please be careful, Mario...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you don't watch your step,[BR]
you'll get burned.[WAIT][END]

10-031
[STYLE:RIGHT]The volcano is dangerous.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Don't push yourself too hard.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you start getting weak, come[BR]
relax at the village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
After all, Lavalava Island is[BR]
just the spot for relaxation.[WAIT][END]

10-032
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mt. Lavalava just started[BR]
erupting, Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's my belief that the volcano[BR]
got angry because Bowser's men[BR]
were fiddling about inside.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm glad you made it out![WAIT][END]

10-033
[STYLE:RIGHT]Mt. Lavalava is becoming less[BR]
active every day.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We don't have to worry about[BR]
lava-proofing the village.[WAIT][END]

10-034
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Village Leader is my friend.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I mean, hello! How are you?[BR]
{Func_04}[WAIT][NEXT]
But anyway, ever since he was[BR]
a child, the Village Leader has[BR]
had a very strong sense of[BR]
personal responsibility.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When I heard he was going to be[BR]
the Village Leader, I wasn't[BR]
surprised at all.[WAIT][END]

10-035
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Village Leader used to get[BR]
into all sorts of mischief when[BR]
he was younger. He used to give[BR]
his parents fits![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The jungle wasn't as dangerous[BR]
back then as it is now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He used to climb trees, throw[BR]
rocks, tease Ravens...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]You name some mischief, and I[BR]
guarantee you he did it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...Heh heh.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Maybe you'd better not tell him[BR]
I told you all that stuff.[WAIT][END]

10-036
[STYLE:RIGHT]Aah! No! Oh, no![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The village...there's...big trouble[BR]
at the village![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please, ask the Village Leader[BR]
about what's happened.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I don't dare talk about it![WAIT][END]

10-037
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, Mario! Please![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Find those poor children![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Yoshi Kids from this village[BR]
are like grandchildren to me.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, those poor babies...[WAIT][END]

10-038
[STYLE:RIGHT]I don't know how to thank you[BR]
for saving the children![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You've done a great thing.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Village Leader said there's[BR]
something he wants to give you,[BR]
you know.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's waiting for you over there.[WAIT][END]

10-039
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hello, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We owe you a deep debt for[BR]
saving our sweet children.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please think of this village as if[BR]
it were your home.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We will always welcome you.[WAIT][END]

10-03A
[STYLE:RIGHT]You went into Mt. Lavalava?[BR]
How brave you are, Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Village Leader and I went up[BR]
to the volcano a long time ago,[BR]
but I never thought about going[BR]
inside![WAIT][END]

10-03B
[STYLE:RIGHT]It's really rare for Mt.[BR]
Lavalava to erupt.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It really caught me off guard.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It once erupted when the Village[BR]
Leader and I were kids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I was surprised then, too. I[BR]
thought that the sky and earth[BR]
were trading places.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...Hey. Don't tell anyone, but[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]the Village Leader couldn't even[BR]
move because he was paralyzed[BR]
with terror. Ha ha![WAIT][END]

10-03C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hi, Mario! What an unexpected[BR]
pleasure![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How's your adventure going?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I hope you'll have time to relax[BR]
while you're on the island.[WAIT][END]

10-03D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hi! Hello. Howdy![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This is Yoshi's Village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mt. Lavalava, you say?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, the volcano is just to the[BR]
east of our village, but there's[BR]
no way to reach it.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Besides, the Village Leader said[BR]
it's best not to get too close[BR]
because it looks like it might[BR]
erupt any day.[WAIT][END]

10-03E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, no! Someone help![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Emergency! Eeeemergency![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The kids are gone![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I looked along the shore, but[BR]
there was no trace of them![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, where could they be...?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What if they're in trouble in the[BR]
jungle somewhere?[WAIT][END]

10-03F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, no! Someone help![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Emergency! Eeeemergency![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The kids are gone![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I looked along the shore, but[BR]
there was no trace of them![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, where could they be...?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What if they're in trouble in the[BR]
jungle somewhere?[WAIT][END]

10-040
[STYLE:RIGHT]Wandering around in the jungle [BR]
without any adults...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I wonder where my poor son[BR]
could be...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm worried sick about him.[BR]
Where would he hide?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, please find my son![WAIT][END]

10-041
[STYLE:RIGHT]My son is back![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, I'm so relieved.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was really starting to worry.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please, Mario, find the other[BR]
lost children, OK?[WAIT][END]

10-042
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thanks to you, the kids are all[BR]
back, safe and sound.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, thank you so much![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Our Village Leader said he wants[BR]
to thank you personally.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Go see him, please![WAIT][END]

10-043
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm glad the kids are back [BR]
safely, but...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
they're causing mischief again.[BR]
Children can be so troublesome![WAIT][END]

10-044
[STYLE:RIGHT]That eruption was terrible! [BR]
It went... KA-WHOOMP!![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I've never seen anything like[BR]
that before, that's for sure![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I don't think the lava will come[BR]
near the village, [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]but it's still kind of unnerving.[WAIT][END]

10-045
[STYLE:RIGHT]Every time we adults turn our[BR]
backs for a second, the kids[BR]
start getting into trouble.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Do you think I should wish to the[BR]
Stars that they become well-[BR]
behaved, model children?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Somehow I think that wish is[BR]
beyond the power of the Star[BR]
Spirits...[WAIT][END]

10-046
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey there, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Have you met the Ravens yet?[BR]
They live at the top of the[BR]
biggest tree in the village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are lots of them, but they[BR]
never come down.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]They speak a different language[BR]
from ours, too.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Pretty mysterious, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Everyone says they're the[BR]
disciples of the master of this[BR]
island, Raphael the Raven,[BR]
but... [PAUSE:0A]Do you really think so?[WAIT][END]

10-047
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, man! What're we gonna do?[BR]
The kids have disappeared![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Aw, what should we do?[BR]
We've gotta do something![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
OK, calm down... Get ahold of[BR]
yourself... We should consult[BR]
the Village Leader...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...Yes, the Leader'll know...[WAIT][END]

10-048
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, man! What're we gonna do?[BR]
The kids have disappeared![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Aw, what should we do?[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
OK, calm down... Get ahold of[BR]
yourself... We should consult[BR]
the Village Leader...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...Yes, the Leader'll know...[WAIT][END]

10-049
[STYLE:RIGHT]Playing hide-and-seek? [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]He should know better than to[BR]
play that in the jungle![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He could be stranded on some[BR]
remote little islet right now,[BR]
crying his head off.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, how terrible... I'm so[BR]
worried...[WAIT][END]

10-04A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thank you for finding my son![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Please, if you could, find the[BR]
other boys as well.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, that little monster...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I thought he'd been unusually[BR]
quiet recently. Just look what[BR]
he was planning![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm going to give him a scolding[BR]
he'll never forget![WAIT][END]

10-04B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Those boys promised they'd[BR]
never go into the jungle alone...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Little troublemakers...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This could have turned into a[BR]
serious situation if you hadn't[BR]
found them, Mario.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You wouldn't believe the scolding[BR]
I gave them. They ought to[BR]
behave themselves for a while.[BR]

Mt. Lavalava would erupt.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess I should've listened[BR]
when the Village Leader said it[BR]
looked like it would erupt.[BR]
I hope it never does again![WAIT][END]

10-04E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Is something bad happening?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I feel like you only show up[BR]
where there's danger.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Ha ha...maybe not always.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Good luck on your adventures.[WAIT][END]

10-04F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Well, well... [PAUSE:05]Hello![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]If it isn't Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Welcome to Lavalava Island![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
This island's almost entirely[BR]
covered by a thick jungle.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Still, how can you beat living[BR]
in this tropical climate?[WAIT][END]

10-050
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh! We have a huge problem![BR]
The children have disappeared![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well! What should I...?[BR]
Hmm...oh...what'll...no...[BR]
Village Leader...should...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Auuugh! I can't explain![WAIT][END]

10-051
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh! We have a huge problem![BR]

Well! What should I...?[BR]
Hmm...oh...what'll...no...[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Auuugh! I can't explain![WAIT][END]

10-052
[STYLE:RIGHT]Where on earth could my son be![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, if we don't find him soon,[BR]
he might be in grave danger...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
No... I know my son. Probably[BR]
sleeping in some tree somewhere.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, please find my son next![WAIT][END]

10-053
[STYLE:RIGHT]Aw, Mario! Thank you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I can't tell you how relieved I[BR]
felt when I saw my son's face.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
...I shouldn't say that so loud.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There are still kids out there,[BR]
lost in the jungle.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Please, you have to find them![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I hope they aren't somewhere[BR]
scary, alone and afraid...[WAIT][END]

10-054
[STYLE:RIGHT]I'm so glad the kids are safely[BR]
back from that dangerous[BR]
jungle...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We owe you, Mario![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The kids seemed like they got[BR]
scared by the experience, but[BR]
[PAUSE:05]they still didn't learn anything.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sigh...[WAIT][END]

10-055
[STYLE:RIGHT]The kids looked shaken up when[BR]
they first got back from the[BR]
jungle, but they're OK now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They didn't learn their lesson.[BR]
Those little scamps.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Still... I can't be angry at them.[BR]
I'm so happy they're safe.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's all thanks to you.[WAIT][END]

10-056
[STYLE:RIGHT]I was taking a nap and all of[BR]
a sudden I heard a KAABOOOOM,[BR]
and the earth started shaking[BR]
like it was gonna split open![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I never believed any of the[BR]
eruption rumors,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
so I thought the entire island[BR]
was moving somewhere.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]That was no fun at all.[WAIT][END]

10-057
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hello again![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Just couldn't stay away from[BR]
scenic Lavalava Island, huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The kids will be really happy.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Why don't you say hi to them?[WAIT][END]

10-058
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, it's so rare to have visitors[BR]
these days.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'd love to stop and chat, but[BR]
I have my fins full.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm watching these boys, who are[BR]
very, VERY naughty, so they[BR]
don't do anything dangerous.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I can't prove it yet, but I bet[BR]
they're planning something...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Well, if they think they can fool[BR]
Sushie, they'd better think[BR]
again![WAIT][END]

10-059

Well, if they think they can fool[BR]
Sushie, they'd better think[BR]

10-05A
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, welcome![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We don't get visitors to this[BR]
island very often.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You should know that the jungle[BR]
beyond here is dangerous.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Our kids are forbidden to go in.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, and by the way, I just saw[BR]
a Koopa guy who calls himself[BR]
an archaeologist running in the [BR]
opposite direction...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He was saying something about[BR]
finding a way to the volcano.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Now there's a guy who's heading[BR]
for danger...[WAIT][END]

10-05B
[STYLE:RIGHT]It's terrible! Just terrible![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The kids are all gone![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We told them a thousand times[BR]
never go into the jungle![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sushie went after them! She's a[BR]
Cheep Cheep who always takes[BR]
care of the kids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How could this have happened![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]There must be a reason![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mario, please! Please help![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Look for the kids![WAIT][END]

10-05C
[STYLE:RIGHT]It's terrible! Just terrible![BR]

10-05D
[STYLE:RIGHT]Ohhhhh...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Where could my kid have gone!?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I hope he wasn't playing on any[BR]
spinning flowers.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
When you spin on those flowers,[BR]
you'll fly up into the air. Who[BR]
knows where you'll come down![WAIT][END]

10-05E
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thank you for finding my son![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He's a bad boy for making[BR]
everybody worry so. Very bad![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm still worried about the other[BR]
boys, too...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
There are so many dangers in[BR]
the jungle...so many creatures[BR]
with evil hearts...[WAIT][END]

10-05F
[STYLE:RIGHT]Everyone has finally calmed down[BR]
since you found the kids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Thank you, thank you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Children are treasured by[BR]
everyone in the village.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That reminds me... The Village[BR]
Leader wishes to thank you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You should go over to see him.[WAIT][END]

10-060
[STYLE:RIGHT]Everyone has finally calmed down[BR]
since you found the kids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Thank you, thank you![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Children are treasured by[BR]
everyone in the village.[WAIT][END]

10-061
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, Mario, you're OK![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]After that huge eruption, we[BR]
wondered if you made it out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The Village Leader claims that[BR]
Bowser's men heated up the[BR]
volcano too much so it blew.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I could do without such scary[BR]
natural disasters, thank you.[WAIT][END]

10-062
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hi, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Welcome back![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How are things on the mainland?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Our children love to hear stories[BR]
from afar...and I guess I kind[BR]
of do, too.[WAIT][END]

10-063
[STYLE:RIGHT]How are you, Mario?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hey, have you talked with the [BR]
Cheep Cheep over there yet?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She's famous around here for[BR]
being a great baby-sitter. Her[BR]
name is Sushie.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
She watches over the kids.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]What would we do without her?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sometimes the kids complain[BR]
about her, but kids are kids.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
By the way, an archaeologist [BR]
named Kolorado or something [BR]
went into the jungle alone.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
He said he was making for[BR]
Mt. Lavalava, but the path ends[BR]
halfway there. I wonder how far[BR]
he got...[WAIT][END]

10-064
[STYLE:RIGHT]The kids are gone![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]The only place they could have[BR]
gone is...gulp!...the jungle![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I had a feeling they were up to[BR]
something lately,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
but I thought it was just[BR]
mischief! I didn't think they'd[BR]
go into such a dangerous area![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What do we do?![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How will we find them?![WAIT][END]

10-065
[STYLE:RIGHT]The kids are gone![BR]

What do we do!?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]How will we find them?![WAIT][END]

10-066
[STYLE:RIGHT]Where? Where are those kids?![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Where could my son be?![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
How deep into the jungle could[BR]
a little kid get?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, what if some nasty creature[BR]
attacks him and...[BR]
[PAUSE:14]Oh, I can't even think about it![BR]
I'm so worried![WAIT][END]

10-067
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thanks for saving my son![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Really! Thanks so much![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I don't want to imagine what [BR]
might have happened if he'd [BR]
stayed out there longer...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh, but other kids ARE still out[BR]
there! The poor dears.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Please find them, Mario.[WAIT][END]

10-068
[STYLE:RIGHT]The kids are all back![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was heartbroken thinking of[BR]
how scared and lonely they must[BR]
have been,[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
but as soon as they got back,[BR]
they just said they were hungry.[BR]
Pfff! Kids! How typical.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I suppose it's natural for[BR]
children to be energetic, but[BR]
they need to be safe, too.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
They never learn... Oh, by the[BR]
way, our Village Leader wants[BR]
to thank you.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You'd better go see him.[WAIT][END]

10-069
[STYLE:RIGHT]The kids are all back![BR]

10-06A
[STYLE:RIGHT]The eruption of Mt. Lavalava[BR]
really threw me for a loop.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I think I lost my appetite.[WAIT][END]

10-06B
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hello again, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Great to see you![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Eat anything tasty lately?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Everyone seems jolly when they[BR]
have something good to eat.[WAIT][END]

10-06C
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Mmm...? {EndFX:Shrinking}Sniff sniff...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Something smells...really good...[BR]
[PAUSE:0F]Is that delicious smell coming[BR]
from something you're carrying?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Whatever it is, I want to try it![BR]
[PAUSE:05]C'mon, what is it?[WAIT][END]

10-06D
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Ooh, thank you![HEART][BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}It looks so good...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh yeah...[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Here, why don't you take this[BR]
as a thank-you from me.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It grows in a place that only[BR]
I know about.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Trust me--it's good![WAIT][END]

10-06E
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}What? No!?[BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}Oh, lame...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Listen to my stomach growl! If[BR]
you change your mind, bring me[BR]
something tasty.[BR]
[PAUSE:05]Something I've never eaten...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
My belly and I are waiting![HEART][WAIT][END]

10-06F
[STYLE:RIGHT]We're the Fearsome 5 of Yoshi's[BR]
Village! Yeah![BR]
[PAUSE:05]We play hide-and-seek together.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We can't leave the village,[BR]
though, so it's sorta boring.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wanna play somewhere bigger[BR]
and more exciting![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
And I wanna see the jungle![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's dangerous, y'know![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Now that'd be exciting![WAIT][END]

10-070
[STYLE:RIGHT]Hey, thanks for finding me![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]This jungle's full of danger.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean, the village is boring.[BR]
Compared to the village, the[BR]
jungle's really exciting.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It was scary, yeah, but fun.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I guess I have to be a good boy[BR]
for a while now.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You'd better find the other guys[BR]
soon before they get lost.[WAIT][END]

10-071
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Fearsome 5 are baaaaack![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]We got scolded, so we'll be[BR]
good...for now. Heh heh...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But we'll be back doing exciting[BR]
things again soon! Yeah![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, Mario, what're you doing[BR]
now, huh? Something fun?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What? You're gonna go inside the[BR]
volcano?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Oh boy, that sounds awesome![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I wish I could go, too.[WAIT][END]

10-072
[STYLE:RIGHT]{StartFX:Shrinking}Kwwaaaaaa-yaaaaah![BR]
{EndFX:Shrinking}Ra[PAUSE:05]di[PAUSE:05]cal![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Eruptions are awesome![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was so scared and excited[BR]
that I couldn't sit still![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, Mario! Were you inside the[BR]
volcano when it blew up? Huh?[BR]
Were you?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Wooooowee![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]What was it like? Huh?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
What? You're in a hurry?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, man. What a bummer.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You've gotta promise me you'll[BR]
come back here someday![WAIT][END]

10-073
[STYLE:RIGHT]Yes! Mario is back![BR]

We've been waiting for you.[BR]

[PAUSE:05]Tell us, [PAUSE:03]tell us, [PAUSE:03]tell us now![WAIT][END]

10-074
[STYLE:RIGHT]Oh, [PAUSE:08]it's Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Hey, Mario.[BR]
[PAUSE:14]Are you looking for adventure?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
If you want, we'll go with you.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
You won't have to worry at all.[BR]
The Fearsome 5's got your back![BR]
[PAUSE:05]Let's go to the jungle![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
We're not scared! We just can't[BR]
ever go 'cause that meddlesome[BR]
ol' Cheep Cheep stops us.[WAIT][END]

10-075
[STYLE:RIGHT]We just wanted to go somewhere[BR]
exciting where there were no[BR]
grown-ups and where we could do[BR]
whatever we wanted. See?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I mean, so we went into the[BR]
jungle and all, but[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]it was scary, and there were[BR]
bad guys, and I got tired...[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'll be good...for now.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm sorry if people worried.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm glad you found me.[WAIT][END]

10-076
[STYLE:RIGHT]The Fearsome 5 are baaaack![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]When all of us are together, we[BR]
fear nothing and nobody![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Sure, the jungle was scary, but[BR]
did we have fun? Oh, yeah![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I think it's time for another[BR]
adventure of the Fearsome 5![WAIT][END]

10-077

of the mountain?[BR]
[PAUSE:05]{StartFX:Shrinking}Da[PAUSE:03]zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzling!![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Something else flew out, too.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Looks like checking it out is a[BR]
job for the Fearsome 5![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
But... I guess we can't.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Until I get bigger, I guess I'll[BR]
just listen to the stories of[BR]
your adventures.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So that means you have to come[BR]
visit us all the time and tell us[BR]
stories, Mario![WAIT][END]

10-078
[STYLE:RIGHT]Whoopee! Yippee!! Hooray!!![BR]
[PAUSE:05]You came back, Mario![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You came to hang with the 5![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Tell us all about your[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
If you do, we'll tell you all the[BR]
tricks we played while you were[BR]

10-07B

A postman's job is never done.[WAIT][END]

10-07C
[STYLE:RIGHT]Thanks. I wonder what it is.[BR]
[PAUSE:14]Oh, my pal made up a new game![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I've gotta play this later![BR]

He also wants me to come over[BR]
to his town and play with him[BR]
sometime.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But how can I get there?[BR]
[PAUSE:14][WAIT][NEXT]
...Oh well.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Maybe someday I'll be able to[BR]
cross the sea and hang out.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
It's really funny, 'cause I was[BR]
just writing him a letter about[BR]
a game I made up![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Mr. Parakarry, will you help?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Here. Deliver my letter to the[BR]
Toad Kid who asked you to send[BR]

[WAIT][NEXT]
Could you? Thanks!![WAIT][END]

10-07D

We're together when we play and[BR]

Of course, now we won't be.[BR]
We're playing hide-and-seek,[BR]
and I'm "it." I hate being "it."[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hmmmph...[WAIT][END]

10-07E
[STYLE:RIGHT]That jungle was dangerous, huh?[BR]
And scary, too, right?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
People told us not to go, but it[BR]
made us want to even more.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Now I won't go anymore.[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I'm really sorry for making[BR]
everyone worry so much.[BR]

And now some of the guys are[BR]
still out there! Sniffle...[BR]

There was danger! Intrigue![BR]
Yoshi-eating beasts![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]I was a little scared! [BR]
[PAUSE:0A]But I wanna go there again![BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Tee hee...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Oh, no. [PAUSE:0A]Just kidding.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Hey, Mario, are you really going[BR]
to the volcano now?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]It's really hot. And dangerous.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
Grown-ups always tell us not to[BR]
go to dangerous places, but[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]you're allowed to go?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
That's not fair![BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Kids get no respect![WAIT][END]

10-080
[STYLE:RIGHT]Did ya see that eruption?[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
The other 4 were surprised, but[BR]
I wasn't. Not too much, anyway.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
I'm different from the others.[BR]
A little braver, you know.[BR]
[WAIT][NEXT]
So, are you leaving now?[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]Uh-huh...[BR]
[PAUSE:0A]You could drop by every now and[BR]
then if you wanted.[BR]

If you want, you can hang with[BR]

Speaking of which, today's the[BR]

Only we 5 know the plan, and[BR]

Hey, but some of the guys still[BR]
