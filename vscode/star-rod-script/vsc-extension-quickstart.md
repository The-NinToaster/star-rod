# Welcome to my [VS Code Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension)

### This is a [Syntax Highlighting Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide)

## What's in the folder

* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
* `syntaxes/.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

## Make changes

* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
